The basic idea is to start with a high temperature and gradually cool it down, allowing the algorithm to escape local minima by sometimes accepting worse solutions.\n\nThe function signature is given: simulated_annealing_optimize(f, x0, T0, cooling, iters, seed). So parameters are the function f to minimize, initial x0, initial temperature T0, cooling rate (probably multiplicative, like T = T * cooling each step), number of iterations, and a seed for randomness.\n\nFirst, I should set the random seed for reproducibility. Since it's 1D with Gaussian steps, each iteration, we'll generate a new candidate x_new by adding a Gaussian random variable to the current x. The standard deviation might be related to the current temperature. Wait, in some implementations, the step size is proportional to the temperature. So maybe the step is generated as x_current + T * random.gauss(0, 1). Or perhaps the standard deviation is T. Let me check.\n\nIn simulated annealing, the proposal distribution can vary. For 1D, using a Gaussian step with variance proportional to temperature makes sense. So each step, we sample a new x as current x plus a Gaussian noise scaled by the current temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"Gaussian steps\", so maybe the step size is determined by a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation perhaps fixed or related to temperature. The problem says \"with Gaussian steps\", so probably the step is drawn from a normal distribution, possibly scaled by the current temperature.\n\nLet me think. In standard SA, the acceptance probability for a new state with energy E_new compared to current E_old is exp(-(E_new - E_old)/T). If E_new is better (lower, since we're minimizing), we always accept. If worse, we accept with probability exp(-delta_E / T).\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Initialize x_current = x0, x_best = x0, f_current = f(x_current), f_best = f_current.\n2. Set T = T0.\n3. For each iteration in iters:\n   a. Generate a new x_new = x_current + step, where step is Gaussian. The problem says \"Gaussian steps\", so step ~ N(0, sigma). But what's sigma? Maybe sigma is proportional to T. In some implementations, the step size decreases as T decreases. So perhaps step = random.gauss(0, T). Because as T cools, the steps get smaller.\n   b. Compute f_new = f(x_new).\n   c. Compute delta_E = f_new - f_current.\n   d. If delta_E < 0 (better), accept x_new.\n   e. Else, accept with probability exp(-delta_E / T).\n   f. If accepted, set x_current = x_new, f_current = f_new.\n   g. If f_new is better than f_best, update x_best and f_best.\n   h. Cool the temperature: T = T * cooling. (Assuming cooling is a factor like 0.95, so T decreases each iteration.)\n\nWait, the cooling parameter is given as 'cooling', which is a float. So probably T is multiplied by cooling each iteration. So T starts at T0, then T = T0 * cooling, then T0 * cooling^2, etc.\n\nWait, but sometimes cooling is done as T = T0 / (1 + cooling * iteration), but the problem states the parameters as T0 and cooling, so likely it's a multiplicative factor. For example, cooling rate of 0.9 means T becomes 0.9*T each step.\n\nSo in each iteration, after possibly accepting a new x, we update T = T * cooling.\n\nWait, but in some implementations, the cooling is applied after a certain number of steps, but the problem says 'iters' is the number of iterations, so each iteration we do one step and cool once.\n\nSo steps per iteration: generate a neighbor, decide to accept or not, then cool.\n\nNow, the step generation: Gaussian steps. So each step, the new x is x_current + random.gauss(0, step_size). But what's the step_size? The problem says \"Gaussian steps\", but doesn't specify the variance. In SA, the step size often scales with temperature. So perhaps step_size = T. So new x is x_current + T * random.gauss(0,1).

So the move from current x is a Gaussian random variable. So, for each step, the new x is current x + step, where step is sampled from N(0, sigma^2). But what is sigma here? The problem doesn't mention it as a parameter, so maybe sigma is fixed, perhaps 1.0? Or maybe the step size is related to the temperature. Wait, but the parameters given are T0 and cooling. Maybe the step size is kept constant, and the temperature affects the acceptance probability.\n\nWait, in standard SA, the temperature is used in the acceptance probability, not directly in the step generation. The step generation (the proposal distribution) can be separate. So perhaps here, the steps are Gaussian with a fixed standard deviation (like 1), and the temperature is used for the Metropolis criterion.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"Gaussian steps\", which probably means that the proposal is a Gaussian distribution. So for each iteration, we generate a candidate x_new = x_current + step, where step is a random variable from a normal distribution. The standard deviation of this normal distribution might be a parameter, but since it's not given in the function parameters, perhaps it's fixed (e.g., 1.0). Alternatively, maybe the step size is adjusted based on temperature, but the problem doesn't specify that. The user probably expects a standard implementation where the step is Gaussian, perhaps with a fixed variance.\n\nWait, the problem says \"SA in 1D with Gaussian steps\". So the proposal distribution is Gaussian. So, for each iteration, the step is drawn from a normal distribution.

The solution should use dynamic programming over subsets.\n\nFirst, I remember that for counting topological sorts, especially with small n (like up to 20), a common approach is to use DP where the state is a bitmask representing the set of nodes that have been included in the sort so far. This is because 20 nodes mean 2^20 possible subsets, which is manageable (around a million states).\n\nThe idea is that for each subset S, we can determine which nodes can be added next (i.e., nodes whose in-degree from nodes not in S is zero). Wait, but how do we track the dependencies?\n\nWait, another way: For a given subset S, the nodes that can be added next are those that have all their predecessors already in S. So for each node, we can precompute its dependencies (the set of nodes that must come before it). Then, when considering subset S, a node v can be added to S if all predecessors of v are in S.\n\nSo the DP state dp[mask] represents the number of topological orderings for the subset of nodes represented by mask.\n\nThe recurrence would be: for each mask, for each node v not in mask, if all predecessors of v are in mask, then dp[mask | (1 << v)] += dp[mask].\n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty set has one ordering).\n\nBut how to compute the predecessors for each node?\n\nFirst, we need to build an adjacency list. Wait, but for the purpose of checking if all predecessors are in the mask, perhaps we can precompute for each node a bitmask of its prerequisites. Let's say for node i, prereq[i] is a bitmask where the j-th bit is 1 if there is an edge from j to i (i.e., j must come before i). Wait, no: if there's an edge j → i, then j must come before i, so for node i to be added, all j such that j → i must be in the current mask.\n\nSo for each node i, the prerequisite mask is the OR of (1 << j) for each edge (j, i). Wait, but the edges are given as (u, v), meaning u → v. So for node v, all u where (u, v) is an edge must be in the mask before v can be added.\n\nSo for each node v, we can precompute a bitmask that represents all nodes that must be present before v can be added. Let's call this pre[v].\n\nSo pre[v] = OR over all u where (u, v) is in edges of (1 << u).\n\nThen, for a given mask, a node v can be added if (pre[v] & ~mask) == 0.

For each mask, iterate over all nodes not in mask.\n\n5. For each node v not in mask, check if (pre[v] & ~mask) == 0. If yes, then dp[mask | (1 << v)] += dp[mask].\n\n6. The final answer is dp[(1 << n) - 1] modulo mod.\n\nWait, but we have to make sure that the graph is a DAG. However, the problem statement probably assumes the input is a DAG, as topological sorts exist only for DAGs.

So for each edge (u, v), we note that u must come before v.\n\nWait, but the nodes are 0-based? The problem says n is the number of nodes, and edges are tuples of ints. So assuming nodes are 0 to n-1.\n\nSo pre[v] for each node v (0 ≤ v < n) is a bitmask where for each edge (u, v), we set the u-th bit.\n\nWait, no: for edge (u, v), u is the predecessor, so to add v, u must be in the mask.

I need to define a function count_topo_sorts_mod that counts the number of topological sorts for a directed graph with n nodes (n ≤ 20), given a list of edges, modulo a given number (default 1e9+7).\n\nHmm, topological sort counts. Right, for a DAG, the number of topological orderings can be found using dynamic programming over subsets. Since n is up to 20, using bitmask DP makes sense here because 2^20 is about a million, which is manageable.\n\nSo the idea is: for each subset of nodes, we can compute the number of ways to arrange that subset in topological order. The DP state will be dp[mask], which represents the number of topological orderings for the subset represented by 'mask'.\n\nHow to transition? For a given mask, we look for all nodes that can be the last node in the topological order of this subset. A node can be last if it has no incoming edges from other nodes in the subset. Wait, no—actually, in a topological sort, the last node must have all its dependencies (predecessors) already included in the subset. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in a topological sort, for each node, all its predecessors (nodes with edges pointing to it) must come before it. So, for a subset S, a node v in S can be the last element of the topological sort of S only if all predecessors of v are in S and are placed before v. But since we're considering the last element, all predecessors of v must be in S (since S is the entire subset), and none of the predecessors can be v itself. Wait, but if v is in S, then for v to be the last element, all its predecessors must be in S (which they are, because S contains v and the predecessors must be part of the graph), but actually, the predecessors could be outside S. Wait no—if S is the subset we're considering, then the predecessors that are not in S would violate the condition. Wait, no. Because if a node u has an edge to v, then in the topological sort of the entire graph, u must come before v. But if we're considering a subset S that includes v but not u, then S cannot be a valid subset for a topological sort because u is a predecessor of v but not in S. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, no. Wait, the subset S must be a closed set under predecessors? No. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP state is for subsets that are \"downward closed\" in the DAG, meaning that if a node is in the subset, all its predecessors are also in the subset. But that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no. For a topological sort, the order must have all predecessors before the node. So for any subset S that is a prefix of a topological sort, S must contain all predecessors of every node in S. So when building up the topological sort, each step adds a node with all its predecessors already in the current subset.\n\nTherefore, for the DP, the mask represents a subset S where S is a valid prefix (i.e., for every node in S, all its predecessors are also in S). Wait, no. Because when you add a node v to the subset, you can only do so if all predecessors of v are already in the subset. So the DP transitions would be adding a node v to a subset S' to form S = S' ∪ {v}, where all predecessors of v are in S'.\n\nTherefore, for each mask S, dp[S] is the number of topological orderings for the subset S. To compute dp[S], we look for all nodes v in S such that all predecessors of v are in S \\ {v} (i.e., in S without v). Then, dp[S] is the sum of dp[S \\ {v}] for all such v.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the last node added to S is v, and before that, the subset was S without v, which must have included all predecessors of v.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute for each node, the set of predecessors (in-neighbors). Let's call this pred[v].\n\n2. Initialize dp[0] = 1 (empty subset has one way).\n\n3. For each mask from 1 to (1 << n) - 1:\n\n   a.

The approach should use dynamic programming over subsets. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, topological sort counts: for a DAG, the number of valid topological orderings. Since n is up to 20, using bitmask DP where each state represents a subset of nodes that have been processed makes sense. The standard approach for counting topological sorts with DP over subsets is to track which nodes have been included in the prefix of the sort, and for each subset, count the number of ways to reach that subset.\n\nThe key idea is that a subset S is a valid prefix if all edges going into S come from within S. Wait, no: in a topological sort, all edges must go from earlier to later nodes. So for a subset S, which represents the first k nodes in the sort (where k is the size of S), every node in S must have all its incoming edges from within S. Wait, no: actually, for S to be a valid prefix, all predecessors of any node in S must also be in S. Wait, no, the other way: if a node is in S, then all its predecessors (nodes with edges pointing to it) must have been placed before it in the sort. So for S to be a valid prefix (the first |S| nodes), every node in S must have all their incoming edges coming from nodes within S. Wait, no. Let's think: if a node v is in S, then all nodes that have edges to v must also be in S. Because in the topological sort, those predecessors must come before v. So if S is the set of nodes that have been placed in the sort so far, then for any node v in S, all in-neighbors of v must also be in S. So for a given subset S, it's a valid state if for every node v in S, all predecessors of v are in S.\n\nSo the DP state will be dp[mask], which represents the number of ways to arrange the nodes in the subset represented by mask as a valid prefix of a topological sort.\n\nTo compute dp[mask], we can consider that the last node added to the subset is some node v. For v to be added to mask \\ {v}, all predecessors of v must already be in mask \\ {v}. Wait, no: when adding v to the subset S = mask \\ {v}, the predecessors of v must all be in S. So for v to be a valid node to add to S to form mask, S must contain all predecessors of v.\n\nSo the recurrence is: for each mask, dp[mask] is the sum over all nodes v in mask such that (mask without v) contains all predecessors of v, of dp[mask without v].\n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty subset, one way).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the in-degree dependencies for each node. Wait, but more precisely, for each node v, we need to know which nodes must be present before v can be added. That is, the set of predecessors (nodes with edges to v). Let's precompute for each node v, a bitmask of its predecessors. For example, pred_mask[v] is a bitmask where the i-th bit is set if there is an edge from i to v.\n\nWait, but edges are given as tuples (u, v), meaning u -> v. So for node v, all u such that (u, v) is an edge are predecessors.\n\nSo for each node v, pred_mask[v] = bitmask of all u where (u, v) is an edge.\n\nThen, for a subset S (mask), to check if v can be added (so S = mask without v), we need that pred_mask[v] is a subset of S. Because all predecessors of v must be in S.\n\nSo the condition is: (pred_mask[v] & ~S) == 0. Which is equivalent to (pred_mask[v] | S) == S, or pred_mask[v] is a subset of S.\n\nSo when building dp[mask], for each node v in mask, check if pred_mask[v] is a subset of (mask without v). If yes, then dp[mask] += dp[mask without v].\n\nNow, how to compute this.\n\nFirst, precompute for each node v, the predecessor mask.\n\nThen, iterate over all masks from 0 to (1 << n) - 1.\n\nFor each mask, for each node v not in mask (wait, no: for each mask, we look at nodes that are in mask, and check if they can be the last added node).\n\nWait, the standard approach is:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 1.\n\nFor each mask from 1 to (1<<n)-1:\n\n   dp[mask] = 0\n\n   for each node v in mask:\n\n       if", "length_tokens": 2351}

The constraints say n is up to 20, so using DP over subsets makes sense here.\n\nFirst, I remember that for counting topological sorts, one common approach is dynamic programming where the state is a bitmask representing the set of nodes that have been included in the ordering so far. The idea is that for each subset S, we can compute the number of ways to arrange the nodes in S such that all dependencies are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about the DP state. Let dp[mask] be the number of topological orderings for the subset of nodes represented by mask. The mask is a bitmask where each bit represents whether a node is included (1) or not (0).\n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 1, which represents the empty set having one way (doing nothing).\n\nFor transitions, to compute dp[mask], we consider all nodes j that can be added to the subset. A node j can be added if all its predecessors (nodes with edges pointing to j) are already in mask. Wait, no: in topological sort, a node can be added only if all its dependencies (nodes it depends on, i.e., incoming edges) are already placed. So for node j, all nodes i where there's an edge i->j must be in mask before adding j.\n\nWait, the edges are given as (u, v), which probably means u -> v. So for a node v, all u such that (u, v) is in edges must have been placed before v in the topological order.\n\nTherefore, when considering adding node j to the subset mask, we need to check that all predecessors of j (i.e., all u where (u, j) is an edge) are already in mask.\n\nSo for each mask, and for each node j not in mask, if all predecessors of j are in mask, then we can add j to mask, and dp[mask | (1 << j)] += dp[mask].\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute for each node j, the set of predecessors (nodes that have edges pointing to j). Let's call this in_edges[j].\n\n2. Initialize dp[0] = 1.\n\n3. Iterate over all possible masks from 0 to (1 << n) - 1.\n\n4. For each mask, iterate over all nodes j not in mask.\n\n5. Check if all predecessors of j are in mask. If yes, then dp[mask | (1 << j)] += dp[mask].\n\n6. The answer is dp[(1 << n) - 1], modulo mod.\n\nWait, but how do we check if all predecessors are in mask?\n\nFor each node j, the predecessors are stored as a bitmask. Let's precompute a mask for each j, say required[j], which is the bitmask of all predecessors. Then, for a given mask, to check if all predecessors are included, we can do (mask & required[j]) == required[j].\n\nYes. So required[j] is a bitmask where each bit i is 1 if there is an edge (i, j).\n\nWait, but edges are given as (u, v), so for each edge (u, v), u is a predecessor of v.\n\nSo for each node v, required[v] should be the OR of (1 << u) for all u where (u, v) is an edge.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: if there's an edge u → v, then u must come before v. So when adding v to the mask, all u that have edges to v must already be in the mask.\n\nTherefore, required[v] is the set of all u such that (u, v) is an edge. So the bitmask for required[v] would have bits set for each u in predecessors of v.\n\nSo for example, if node v has predecessors u1, u2, then required[v] = (1 << u1) | (1 << u2).\n\nThen, for a given mask, to check if all predecessors are present, we check (mask & required[v]) == required[v].\n\nYes.\n\nSo first step is to compute required for each node.\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nInitialize required = [0] * n.\n\nFor each edge (u, v) in edges:\n\n    required[v] |= (1 << u)\n\nWait, but the nodes are 0-based?

It's a sequence where every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one in the correct order. Like \"()\" is valid, but \")(\" is not. The challenge is to find the longest such substring within the input string.\n\nHmm, the problem reminds me of some classic dynamic programming or stack-based problems. I remember that using a stack can help track the indices of parentheses to find valid sequences.\n\nLet me think about how the stack approach works. The idea is to push the index of '(' onto the stack. When we encounter a ')', we pop the stack. If the stack becomes empty after popping, it means there's no matching '(', so we push the current index as a new starting point. Otherwise, the current valid length is the current index minus the index at the top of the stack.\n\nWait, let me work through an example. Let's take the sample input ')()())'.\n\nIndices: 0: ')', 1: '(', 2: ')', 3: '(', 4: ')', 5: ')'\n\nStarting with the stack. We need to initialize it with -1 as a base, maybe.

Current index 2 minus top of stack (0) is 2. So current max is 2.\n\nAt index 3: '('. Push 3. Stack: [0,3]\n\nAt index 4: ')'. Pop to 3. Now stack top is 0. 4-0=4. So current max is 4.\n\nAt index 5: ')'. Stack is [0]. Pop to empty. Push 5. Now stack is [5]. Current valid length would be 5 - 5 =0, which doesn't update max.\n\nSo the max length is 4. Which would be the substring from index 1 to 4: \"()()\", but wait the input is ')()())', so the valid parts are indices 1-2 (\"()\") and 3-4 (\"()\"), making a combined length of 4. So the answer should be 4.\n\nWait, but let me check. The input is ')()())'. Breaking it down:\n\nIndices:\n\n0: )\n\n1: (\n\n2: )\n\n3: (\n\n4: )\n\n5: )\n\nSo the valid substrings are from 1-2 (length 2), 3-4 (length 2), and perhaps 1-4 (length 4). Because 1-4 is \"()()\", which is valid. So yes, the longest is 4.\n\nSo the algorithm should return 4 for the sample.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nThe steps I thought of:\n\n- Initialize a stack with -1.\n\n- max_length = 0\n\n- Iterate through each character in the string with index i.\n\n   - If the character is '(', push i onto stack.\n\n   - Else (it's ')'):\n\n      - Pop from stack.\n\n      - If stack is empty after pop, push i (as a new starting point).\n\n      - Else, current length is i - stack[-1], update max_length if this is larger.\n\nWait, let me check the logic again.\n\nWait, when we pop, if the stack is not empty, then the current valid length is i minus the new top of the stack.\n\nWait, let's go through the example again with this logic.\n\nSample: s = ')()())'\n\ns[0] = ')'\n\nstack starts as [-1].\n\nPop stack: now empty. So push 0. Stack is [0]. max_length remains 0.\n\ns[1] = '(': push 1. Stack [0,1]\n\ns[2] = ')': pop to 1. Now stack is [0]. Current i=2. Length is 2 - 0 = 2. max_length=2.\n\ns[3] = '(': push 3.

A common way to handle parentheses validation is using a stack. Maybe I can use a stack-based approach here.\n\nWait, the standard approach for this problem is using a stack. Let me recall. The idea is to push -1 onto the stack as a base marker. Then, for each character in the string:\n\n- If it's '(', push the index.\n- If it's ')', pop the stack. If the stack becomes empty, push the current index as a new base. Otherwise, calculate the current length as current index minus the stack's top element.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's see.

The key idea is that each state in the SAM represents a set of substrings that are all suffixes of each other, and the transitions allow building the automaton incrementally.\n\nWait, the number of distinct substrings can be calculated by summing up the number of new substrings added when each character is processed. Or maybe there's a formula based on the states.\n\nOh right! In the SAM, each state has a 'len' which is the length of the longest string in that state. And the number of distinct substrings contributed by a state is len(state) - len(link(state)), where link is the suffix link. Because the suffix link points to the state with the next longest suffix, so the difference gives the number of new substrings that state adds.\n\nSo the total distinct substrings would be the sum over all states (except the initial one maybe?) of (len(state) - len(link(state))). Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the initial state is state 0. When building the SAM, each new state added contributes (current state's len - its link's len).

We create state 2 (cur), len = len(1) +1 = 2.\n- Then we traverse the suffix links of 1. The suffix link of 1 is 0. Now, check if 0 has a transition on 'b'. Initially, no. So we set 0's transition on 'b' to 2. Then set link[2] to 0? Wait no. Wait, when creating state 2, the suffix link is determined as follows: when we clone a state or not.\n\nWait maybe I'm getting confused.

One of its properties is that the number of distinct substrings can be calculated by summing up (len(link) - len(state)) for all states except the initial one. Wait, no, maybe it's the difference between the maximum length of the state and the maximum length of its suffix link.\n\nWait, each state in the SAM represents a set of substrings that are all suffixes of each other.

So the number of new substrings added by the state is maxlen(state) - maxlen(link(state)).\n\nYes, because for each state, the strings it represents have lengths from (link.len + 1) up to state.len. So the count per state is state.len - link.len.

When we add the first character, we create a new state with len 1, and its link would point to state 0. So for that state, the contribution is 1 - 0 = 1, which is correct (the single character).\n\nSo the total number of distinct substrings is the sum over all states (except the initial one) of (state.len - state.link.len).\n\nWait, but the initial state's link might be null, but in code, maybe the link for the initial state is set to -1 or something, but when building the SAM, the initial state's link is usually a null state. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the standard SAM construction, the initial state (state 0) has len 0, and its link is -1 (or some invalid value).

Wait, the suffix link of state 2 would be state 0's link? No.\n\nWait, the standard SAM construction steps:\n\nWhen adding a new character c:\n\n1. Create a new state cur with len = last.len + 1.\n2.

The problem specifies using a suffix automaton (SAM). Let me recall how SAM works.\n\nFrom what I remember, a suffix automaton is a finite automaton that recognizes all suffixes of a string, but it's structured in a way that also captures all substrings. The key property here is that the number of distinct substrings can be calculated using the SAM's structure.\n\nEach state in the SAM represents a set of substrings that have the same end positions. The transitions between states correspond to adding characters. The main idea for counting distinct substrings is that each state contributes (maxlen[state] - minlen[state] + 1) substrings. Wait, no, maybe it's the difference between the maximum length and the minimum length of the strings in that state. Wait, minlen of a state is len(link) + 1, where link is the suffix link. So the number of distinct substrings contributed by a state is maxlen - minlen + 1? Or maybe maxlen - (minlen - 1) which is maxlen - minlen + 1. Let me think.\n\nWait, for a state, the lengths of the strings it represents range from minlen to maxlen. So the number of distinct substrings in that state is maxlen - minlen + 1. But how do we get minlen? Oh right, minlen(v) = len(link(v)) + 1. So for each state, the count is (maxlen(v) - (len(link(v)) + 1) + 1) = maxlen(v) - len(link(v)).\n\nWait, let's see: if the suffix link of state v is state u, then minlen(v) = len(u) + 1. So the number of distinct substrings in state v is maxlen(v) - minlen(v) + 1 = (maxlen(v) - (len(u) + 1) ) + 1 = maxlen(v) - len(u). So yes, it's maxlen(v) - len(link(v)).\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct substrings is the sum over all states (except the initial one, maybe?) of (maxlen(v) - len(link(v))).\n\nWait, but the initial state (state 0) might have len 0. Let's check. The initial state represents the empty string. So for the initial state, maxlen is 0, and the suffix link is maybe -1 or something. But when building the SAM, the first state created (state 0) has len 0 and link -1 (or null). So when we sum over all states except the initial one, perhaps?\n\nWait, let's think of an example. Let's take s = \"a\".\n\nThe SAM for \"a\" should have states:\n\nState 0: initial, len 0, link -1.\n\nState 1: len 1, link 0.\n\nSo the distinct substrings are \"a\" and the empty string? Wait no, substrings of \"a\" are \"a\" and the empty string? Wait no, substrings are contiguous sequences. For \"a\", the substrings are \"a\" (length 1) and the empty string? Or is the empty string not counted? Wait, the problem says \"distinct substrings\". Typically, when people talk about substrings in such contexts, they might not include the empty string. Wait, but the problem statement here is for the function to return the number of distinct non-empty substrings? Or including empty?\n\nWait, let's check the standard problem. The standard problem of counting distinct substrings usually counts non-empty. For example, for \"a\", the answer is 1. For \"ab\", it's 3 (a, b, ab).\n\nBut according to the SAM approach, the sum over all states (excluding the initial state) of (maxlen - link.len) gives the number of distinct non-empty substrings.\n\nIn the \"a\" example, state 1 has maxlen 1, link is state 0 with len 0. So 1 - 0 = 1, which matches. So the sum would be 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: \"aa\". The distinct substrings are \"a\", \"aa\" → 2.\n\nBuilding the SAM:\n\nState 0: len 0, link -1.\n\nState 1: len 1, link 0. Transitions: 'a' to state 2.\n\nState 2: len 2, link 1.\n\nSo sum is (1-0) + (2-1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: \"ab\".\n\nState 0: len 0.\n\nState 1: len 1 (a), link 0.\n\nState 2: len 1 (b), link 0.\n\nState 3: len 2 (ab), link 1 (since after adding 'b' to state 1, the suffix link of state 3 would point to state 2? Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, building SAM for \"ab\":\n\nStart with state 0.\n\nAdd 'a':\n\ncurrent state is 0, create new state 1 with len 1. Check suffix links.

The problem is to define a function closest_divisors(n) that returns two integers whose product is either n+1 or n+2, and they should be as close to each other as possible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"closest\" means here. I think it refers to the pair of divisors (a, b) where a * b equals either n+1 or n+2, and the difference between a and b is minimized. Because when two numbers multiply to a given product, the pair that's closest to each other would be around the square root of the product.\n\nSo the approach would be: for both n+1 and n+2, find the pair of divisors that are closest to each other. Then compare the two pairs (from n+1 and n+2) and choose the one with the smallest difference.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So for each of the two numbers (n+1 and n+2), find their closest divisor pairs, then pick the pair from either that has the smallest possible difference.\n\nSo first, for a given number x (which is either n+1 or n+2), how do we find the closest divisors?\n\nThe standard way is to start from the integer square root of x and go downwards until we find a divisor. Because the closest pair would be around sqrt(x). For example, for x=10, sqrt is ~3.16, so check 3: 10/3 is not integer. Then 2: 10/2=5. So pair (2,5). But wait, but maybe for x=9, sqrt is 3, so 3 and 3.\n\nSo the steps for x:\n\n1. Compute the integer square root of x, let's say s = int(sqrt(x)).\n\n2. Starting from s down to 1, check if x is divisible by i. The first i found where x % i == 0 will give the pair (i, x//i), which are the closest possible divisors for x.\n\nBecause as we go down from sqrt(x), the first divisor we find will pair with the largest possible complement, making their difference minimal.\n\nSo for each x in [n+1, n+2], we find the closest pair. Then compare the two pairs (from x1 and x2) to see which has the smaller difference.\n\nWait, but how to compare? For example, if x1's closest pair has a difference of d1, and x2's has d2, then choose the pair with the smaller d.\n\nIf d1 == d2, then perhaps either is acceptable, but the problem says \"closest\", so probably either is fine, but maybe the problem expects the one from the smaller x? Or perhaps the problem allows either, but according to the problem statement, it's to find the pair for either n+1 or n+2. So whichever pair is closer (smaller difference) is the answer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For x in [n+1, n+2], find the closest divisor pair (a, b) where a <= b and a*b = x.\n\n- Compare the two pairs (from x1 and x2) based on |a - b|.\n\n- Return the pair with the smallest difference.\n\nNow, how to implement finding the closest pair for x.\n\nLet's take x, compute s = int(sqrt(x)).\n\nLoop from s down to 1:\n\n   if x % i == 0:\n\n       return (i, x // i)\n\nBecause this will give the pair where i is the largest possible <= sqrt(x), so x//i is the smallest possible >= sqrt(x), hence the closest pair.\n\nYes. For example, x=15.\n\nsqrt(15) is ~3.87, so s=3.\n\nCheck 3: 15%3=0, so pair (3,5). Difference 2.\n\nIf x=16, s=4, 16%4=0, so (4,4), difference 0.\n\nAnother example, x=10: s=3. 10%3=1, so check 2: 10%2=0, so (2,5), difference 3.\n\nSo this method works.\n\nSo for each x (n+1 and n+2), find their closest pairs.\n\nThen, compare the two pairs. Which one has the smaller difference between the two numbers.\n\nSo for each x in [n+1, n+2], compute the closest pair, then select the pair with minimal (b - a).\n\nWait, since a <= b, the difference is b - a. So the smaller the difference, the closer they are.\n\nSo for each x, compute (a, b) as closest pair, compute diff = b - a.\n\nThen choose the pair (from x1 or x2) with the smallest diff.\n\nIf both have same diff, then perhaps either is acceptable, but the problem says \"closest\", so perhaps the first one, but the problem statement may not care as long as it's one of them.

The closest pair would be the one where the two numbers are as close as possible to each other, which usually happens around the square root of the number.\n\nSo the approach would be: for each candidate number (n+1 and n+2), find the largest divisor less than or equal to the square root. Because the closest divisors are around the square root. For example, for 10, sqrt(10) is ~3.16, so the divisors are 2 and 5, but 1 and 10. The closest pair would be 2 and 5, but wait, 3.16 is between 3 and 4. Wait, 10's factors are 1x10, 2x5. The closest pair is 2 and 5 with a difference of 3. Wait, but maybe for 12, sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so the closest pair is 3 and 4 (since 3*4=12), difference 1.\n\nSo for each number m (either n+1 or n+2), iterate from int(sqrt(m)) down to 1, and check if m is divisible by i. The first i found would give the pair (i, m//i), which would have the smallest possible difference because we're starting from the square root and moving down.\n\nOnce I have the closest pairs for both m1 = n+1 and m2 = n+2, compare their differences and choose the pair with the smaller difference. If the differences are equal, maybe either is acceptable, but the problem says \"closest\", so perhaps either could be chosen, but the problem statement might specify to prefer one over the other. Wait, the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So among all possible pairs for both numbers, pick the pair with the smallest absolute difference.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1.

Because the closest pair will be around the square root.\n\nFor example, m=15: sqrt is ~3.87. Check 3: 15/3=5. So pair (3,5), difference 2. If m=16, sqrt is 4, so (4,4), difference 0.\n\nSo the algorithm for a single m is:\n\n- Let i = int(sqrt(m))\n- While i >=1:\n   - if m % i ==0, then return (i, m//i)\n   - i -=1\n\nBut since m is at least 1 (since n is a positive integer?), but n could be 0? Wait, the problem says n is an integer. But n+1 or n+2 must be positive. So n >=0, probably. Because if n is negative, n+1 or n+2 could be negative, but divisors would be negative as well. But the problem says \"two integers\", but perhaps the problem assumes positive divisors? Because otherwise, for negative numbers, there are infinite possibilities (like for m=-5, possible pairs (-1,5), (1,-5), etc.), but the closest would be same as absolute value.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2\". So if n+1 is negative, then the divisors could be negative. But the closest pair in terms of absolute difference. However, the problem probably expects positive integers, as divisors in such contexts are usually positive. Let's assume m is positive, so n+1 and n+2 are positive.

Then b = m / a. That pair (a, b) would be the closest possible.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if you take a divisor larger than sqrt(m), then the corresponding b would be smaller, but the difference would be larger. So the closest pair is when a is the largest possible divisor less than or equal to sqrt(m).\n\nSo for each m in [n+1, n+2], compute the integer square root, then check downwards from that value until we find a divisor.\n\nLet's take an example.

So pair (2,5), difference 3.\n\nSo the closest for m=9 is (3,3), which is better. So the function returns (3,3).\n\nAnother example: n=1. Then n+1=2, n+2=3.\n\nFor m=2: sqrt(2) ~1.414.

Let's call it root. So root = int(math.isqrt(m)).\n\n- Then check from root down to 1. The first a where m % a == 0 is the largest possible a <= sqrt(m), so the corresponding b = m // a will be the smallest possible b >= sqrt(m), making the pair (a, b) the closest.\n\nSo for each m, the closest pair is (a, m//a) where a is the largest divisor <= sqrt(m).\n\nSo the steps for each m:\n\n1.

Compare the smallest differences from both m values and choose the pair with the overall smallest difference.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So we need to check both n+1 and n+2, find the closest pair for each, then pick the pair that's closer between the two.\n\nHow to find the closest pair for a given m?\n\nStart from the integer square root of m and go downwards. The first divisor we find will pair with m divided by that, and their difference will be minimal.\n\nFor example, take m=10. sqrt(10) is ~3.16. Check 3: 10/3 is not integer. Next 2: 10/2=5. So pair (2,5), difference 3. But wait, 10 is 1*10 (diff 9) and 2*5 (diff 3). So the closest is 2 and 5.\n\nWait, but maybe for m=9, sqrt is 3, so 3*3=9, which is perfect.\n\nSo the method for a given m:\n\n- Compute sqrt_m = int(sqrt(m))\n- Iterate from sqrt_m down to 1, check if m is divisible by i. The first i found will give the pair (i, m//i), which has the smallest possible difference.\n\nYes, because as we go down from sqrt(m), the first divisor we hit will pair with a number that's as close as possible.\n\nSo for each m (n+1 and n+2), find the pair (a, b) where a is the largest possible <= sqrt(m), so that a*b = m.\n\nThen compare the two pairs (from m1 and m2) and return the one with smaller difference.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"closest_divisors(n:int)->tuple[int,int] two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\"\n\nSo the function should return the pair with the minimal difference between the two possible m's.\n\nWait, but what if both m1 and m2 have the same minimal difference? Then which one to choose? The problem says \"closest\", so if two pairs have same difference, maybe we need to pick one. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps either is acceptable. But perhaps the problem expects the pair from the smaller m? Or maybe it doesn't matter as long as the difference is minimal.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"closest\" so the pair with the smallest possible difference. So if m1 has a pair with difference d1 and m2 has d2, then choose the pair with min(d1, d2). If d1 == d2, then maybe either is acceptable. But according to the problem statement, perhaps we can choose either. But the problem might have a unique answer.\n\nLet me test with some examples.\n\nExample: n=8.\n\nn+1=9, n+2=10.\n\nFor 9: sqrt is 3, 3*3=9. So pair (3,3), difference 0.\n\nFor 10: closest pair is (2,5), difference 3.\n\nSo the answer is (3,3).\n\nAnother example: n=1.\n\nn+1=2, n+2=3.\n\nFor 2: (1,2) diff 1.\n\nFor 3: (1,3) diff 2.\n\nSo answer (1,2).\n\nAnother example: n=5.\n\nn+1=6, n+2=7.\n\n6's closest pair: sqrt(6)=2.45. Check 2: 6/2=3. So (2,3), diff 1.\n\n7 is prime: (1,7) diff 6. So answer (2,3).\n\nAnother example: n=14.\n\nn+1=15, n+2=16.\n\n15: sqrt ~3.87. Check 3: 15/3=5. So (3,5) diff 2.\n\n16: sqrt 4, 4*4=16. So (4,4) diff 0. So answer (4,4).\n\nWait, but n=14: closest divisors would be (4,4) since 16 is n+2.\n\nSo the algorithm should check both m1 and m2, find the closest pair for each, then choose the pair with the smallest difference.\n\nSo the steps for the function:\n\nFor a given n:\n\n1. Compute m1 = n+1, m2 = n+2.\n\n2. For each m in [m1, m2], find the closest factor pair.\n\n3. Compare the two pairs and return the one with the smaller difference.\n\nHow to implement finding the closest pair for a given m:\n\ndef get_closest_pair(m):\n\n    # find the largest factor <= sqrt(m", "length_tokens": 1757}

Let me recall how an LRU cache works.\n\nLRU stands for Least Recently Used. So, when the cache is full and a new item needs to be added, the least recently used item is evicted. The get and put operations should both be O(1) time complexity.\n\nThe standard way to implement this is using a combination of a hash map (dictionary in Python) and a doubly linked list. The hash map allows O(1) access to the nodes, and the doubly linked list allows O(1) removal and addition of nodes. The most recently used items are moved to the front (or head) of the list, and the least recently used is at the end (tail).\n\nWait, but in Python, there's also the OrderedDict from the collections module which can be used to implement LRU cache easily. However, the problem says \"classic LRU\", which might require implementing it from scratch without using OrderedDict. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"define LRUCache2(capacity:int) with get/put like classic LRU\". So probably, they want the implementation using a dictionary and a doubly linked list.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Create a Node class for the doubly linked list. Each node will have key, value, prev, and next pointers.\n\n2. The LRUCache2 class will have:\n   - A dictionary (hash map) to store key: node pairs.\n   - A doubly linked list to maintain the order of usage. The head will be the most recently used, tail the least.\n   - Methods to add a node to the head, remove a node, and move a node to the head.\n\nWait, but in some implementations, the head is the least recently used, and tail is the most. Wait no, usually the most recently used is added to the head, so when you access an item, you move it to the head. So the tail would be the least recently used.\n\nWait, let me think: when you get a key, you need to move it to the most recent position. So if the list is ordered from most recent (head) to least (tail), then adding new nodes to the head, and the tail is the LRU.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to have the head as the most recently used, and the tail as the least. So when we need to evict, we remove the tail.\n\nSo the structure:\n\n- head points to the most recently used node.\n- tail points to the least recently used node.\n\nWhen a get operation happens, the node is moved to the head.\n\nWhen a put operation happens, if the key exists, update the value and move to head. If it doesn't exist, add a new node to the head. If the cache is at capacity, remove the tail node (LRU) before adding the new one.\n\nWait, but how to handle the pointers. Let me outline the steps.\n\nFirst, define the Node class.\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, key, value):\n        self.key = key\n        self.value = value\n        self.prev = None\n        self.next = None\n\nThen, in LRUCache2:\n\n- capacity: int\n- cache: dict (key -> Node)\n- head: Node (most recent)\n- tail: Node (least recent)\n\nWait, but usually, a dummy head and tail are used to simplify the code. Like, have a sentinel head and tail so that you don't have to handle edge cases when the list is empty.\n\nWait, maybe using a doubly linked list with dummy head and tail nodes. So, the actual nodes are between head and tail.\n\nFor example:\n\nhead <-> node1 <-> node2 <-> ... <-> tail\n\nWhere head.next is the most recently used, and tail.prev is the least recently used.\n\nThis makes adding and removing nodes easier.\n\nSo when initializing the LRUCache2:\n\ndef __init__(self, capacity: int):\n    self.capacity = capacity\n    self.cache = {}\n    self.head = Node(None, None)\n    self.tail = Node(None, None)\n    self.head.next = self.tail\n    self.tail.prev = self.head\n\nThen, helper functions:\n\n- _add_node(node): adds the node right after head (so it becomes the most recent)\n- _remove_node(node): removes the node from the list\n- _move_to_head(node): removes the node and adds it to the head\n\nWait, but for get, when we access a node, we need to move it to the head.\n\nFor put, if the key exists, update the value and move to head.

For example, if s is \"ababab\", then p is 2 because \"ab\" repeats three times.\n\nSo the problem is to find the smallest p where len(s) is a multiple of p, and for every i from 0 to len(s)-1, s[i] equals s[i mod p].\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Let's consider possible values of p. The possible p's must be divisors of the length of s. Because if the string is a repetition of a substring of length p, then the total length n must be a multiple of p. So n = k*p for some integer k ≥ 1.\n\nSo first, I should check all possible divisors of n (the length of s) in increasing order. The first p that satisfies the condition (s is a repetition of its first p characters) will be the minimal period.\n\nBut how to check if a given p is a valid period?\n\nFor a given p, we need to check that for all i from p to n-1, s[i] == s[i - p].

So n must be divisible by p. So p must be a divisor of n.\n\nWait, for example, if s is \"aaaa\", then n=4. Possible p's are 1, 2, 4. The minimal is 1.\n\nAnother example: s = \"abab\", n=4. Divisors are 1,2,4. Check p=1: does \"a\" repeat 4 times? s is \"abab\", which is not \"aaaa\", so p=1 is invalid. Next p=2: check if s[2] == s[0] (a == a), s[3] == s[1] (b == b). Yes, so p=2 is valid.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate through possible p's in order from 1 to n (but only those that divide n), and check if they are valid periods.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. For example, for p to be a valid period, it's necessary that p divides n, but is that sufficient? No, the division is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n- For p in 1 to n (but only check p where n % p == 0):\n\n   - Check if s[0:p] repeated (n/p) times equals s.\n\nBut checking this by generating the repeated string would be O(n) per p, which could be inefficient for large n.\n\nAlternatively, check for each i from 0 to n-1, if s[i] == s[i % p].\n\nWait, for i from 0 to n-1, i % p gives the position in the base substring. So for the string to be a repetition, each character must equal the corresponding character in the base substring.\n\nSo for a given p (divisor of n), check that for all i in 0..n-1, s[i] == s[i mod p].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each candidate p (divisors of n in increasing order), check if for all k from 1 to (n/p -1), the substring s[k*p : (k+1)*p] equals s[0:p].\n\nBut again, this would be O(n) per p.\n\nBut since the minimal p is likely small, perhaps this approach is feasible.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Compute n = len(s).\n\n2. Iterate p from 1 to n:\n\n   a. If n % p != 0, skip.\n\n   b. Check if for all i from p to n-1, s[i] == s[i - p].\n\n      Because if the string is built by repeating the first p chars, then each subsequent block of p chars must match the first.\n\n      For example, when p=2 and n=6, the string is s[0:2], s[2:4], s[4:6]. So s[2] should equal s[0], s[3] equals s[1], etc.\n\n      So for i >= p, s[i] must equal s[i - p].\n\n   c. If this condition holds, return p.\n\nWait, but how does this check work?\n\nTake s = \"ababab\", p=2, n=6.\n\nCheck i from 2 to 5:\n\ni", "length_tokens": 2142}

I need to find the minimal period p of a string s. The period is the smallest p such that the string s can be formed by repeating the prefix of length p. For example, if s is \"ababab\", then p would be 2 because \"ab\" repeats three times.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the minimal period means. The period p must satisfy that len(s) is a multiple of p. So, possible values of p are the divisors of the length of s. Wait, not exactly. Because maybe the length isn't a multiple, but the problem says s is a repeat of the prefix. So, for example, if s is \"abcabc\", len is 6, p=3. But if s is \"abcab\", len is 5, which can't be divided by 3. Wait, but the problem states that s is a repeat of the prefix. So the length of s must be a multiple of p. Otherwise, it's impossible. Wait, but the problem says \"s is repeats of prefix length p\". So the length of s must be exactly k*p for some integer k ≥ 1.\n\nSo first, the possible p's are the divisors of len(s). Wait, no. Because for example, if s is \"aaaa\", the possible p could be 1 (since \"a\" repeats 4 times), but 4's divisors are 1, 2, 4. But p=2 would also work, but the minimal is 1.\n\nWait, the minimal p is the smallest possible. So the approach is to check all possible p's from 1 up to len(s), and see if s can be formed by repeating the prefix of length p.\n\nBut how to check that? For a given p, check if for all i in 0..len(s)-1, s[i] == s[i % p].\n\nWait, let's see. For example, s = \"ababab\", p=2. Then for i=0, 0%2=0 → 'a'; i=1, 1%2=1 → 'b'; i=2, 2%2=0 → 'a', etc. So yes, s[i] = s[i%p].\n\nSo the condition is that for all i in 0 to n-1, s[i] == s[i % p].\n\nBut p must divide n, because otherwise, n % p is not zero, but the length of the string must be a multiple of p. Wait, no. Wait, if p is a period, then the length of the string must be a multiple of p. Because otherwise, the last repetition would be incomplete. Wait, but the problem states that s is exactly the repetition of the prefix of length p. So the length must be exactly k*p for some integer k ≥ 1. Therefore, p must be a divisor of len(s).\n\nWait, for example, if s is \"abcabc\", len is 6. Possible p's are 1, 2, 3, 6. But p=1 would require all characters to be 'a', which they aren't. p=2: check if \"ab\" repeated 3 times is s. \"ababab\" which is not the same as \"abcabc\", so no. p=3: \"abc\" repeated twice is \"abcabc\", which matches. So p=3 is the minimal.\n\nWait, but in this case, len(s) is 6, and p=3 divides 6.\n\nAnother example: s = \"abab\", len=4. Possible p: 1, 2,4. p=1: all 'a's? No. p=2: \"ab\" repeated twice is \"abab\", which matches. So p=2 is minimal.\n\nSo the possible candidates for p are the divisors of n (n = len(s)), but we need to check the smallest possible p where the string is composed of repeating the prefix of length p.\n\nWait, but maybe p doesn't have to be a divisor? Wait no, because if s is exactly k times the prefix, then n = k*p, so p must divide n.\n\nTherefore, the minimal p must be a divisor of n.\n\nWait, but what about a case like s = \"aabaab\", n=6. Let's see. The possible p's are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nCheck p=1: all 'a's? No, because third character is 'b'. So no.\n\np=2: prefix is \"aa\". Repeating it 3 times would be \"aaaaaa\", but s is \"aabaab\", which is different. So no.\n\np=3: prefix \"aab\". Repeating twice gives \"aabaab\", which matches. So p=3 is the minimal.\n\nYes, so p must divide n.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n1. For p in 1 to n (but check possible divisors first?), find the smallest p such that:\n\n   a. n % p == 0\n\n   b. s[0:p] * (n // p) == s\n\nBut checking all p from 1 to n might be inefficient for large n, but since the problem is to write a function, perhaps for the purposes of this question, the straightforward approach is acceptable.\n\nWait, but the minimal p might not necessarily be a divisor? Wait no, because if the string is a repetition of the prefix of length p, then the length must be a multiple of p. So p must divide n.\n\nWait, let's test with an example where maybe p is not a divisor. Suppose s = \"abcab\", n=5. Can there be a p=3? Then 5/3 is not integer.

The minimal period here is the smallest p where s can be written as the repetition of its first p characters. For example, if s is \"abab\", then p would be 2 because \"ab\" repeated twice gives \"abab\".\n\nWait, but how do I check this for a given p? Let's think. For a string s of length n, the period p must satisfy that n is a multiple of p. So p has to be a divisor of n. Wait, no. Wait, if the string is a repetition of the prefix of length p, then the total length n must be equal to k*p for some integer k >=1. So p must divide n.

So the p must divide the length of s.\n\nTherefore, possible candidates for p are the divisors of len(s). But the minimal period is the smallest p such that s is equal to (s[0:p]) repeated (n/p) times.\n\nSo the approach would be: for each possible p starting from 1 up to n (the length of s), check if p divides n, and if s is equal to the prefix of length p repeated n/p times. The first such p (smallest) is the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a case where a p that doesn't divide n could still work? Let's see.

Let's see.\n\nHmm, the straightforward approach would be to check all possible combinations of four elements, one from each list. But wait, if each list has n elements, that's O(n^4) time, which is way too slow for large n. Like, if n is 1000, that's 1e12 operations, which is impossible. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. Maybe I can split the problem into two parts. Like, first compute all possible sums from A and B, then compute all possible sums from C and D, and then see how many pairs of sums from the first two and last two add up to zero.\n\nWait, yes! Because (A[i] + B[j]) + (C[k] + D[l]) = 0 is equivalent to (A[i] + B[j]) = -(C[k] + D[l]). So if I can count how many times each sum occurs in A+B and in C+D, then for each sum s in A+B, I check how many times -s occurs in C+D, and multiply those counts.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute all possible sums from A and B. Store the frequency of each sum in a dictionary (hash map).\n2. Compute all possible sums from C and D. For each sum t in this second set, check if -t exists in the first dictionary. The count is incremented by the product of the frequencies.\n\nThis way, the time complexity is O(n^2) for each part, so overall O(n^2), which is manageable even for n=1000 (since 1e6 operations is feasible).\n\nLet me verify. For example, if A and B are each size n, the number of sums is n^2. Same for C and D. So building the first dictionary takes O(n^2), same for the second part. Then, for each of the n^2 sums in the second part, we do a constant-time lookup. So total time is O(n^2), which is much better than O(n^4).\n\nYes, this makes sense.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, for the first two lists, A and B:\n\nsum_ab = {}\nfor a in A:\n    for b in B:\n        s = a + b\n        sum_ab[s] = sum_ab.get(s, 0) + 1\n\nThen, for C and D:\n\ncount = 0\nfor c in C:\n    for d in D:\n        t = c + d\n        count += sum_ab.get(-t, 0)\n\nWait, but what if the sum_ab doesn't have -t? Then get returns 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the total count would be the sum over all possible t in C+D of sum_ab[-t].\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test this with a small example.\n\nSuppose A = [1, -1], B = [1, -1], C = [1, -1], D = [1, -1].\n\nWe need to count all tuples where the sum is zero.\n\nLet's compute sum_ab:\n\nPossible sums:\n\n1+1=2, 1+(-1)=0, (-1)+1=0, (-1)+(-1)=-2.\n\nSo sum_ab would have {2:1, 0:2, -2:1}.\n\nsum_cd would be same as sum_ab.\n\nNow, for each sum in sum_cd, say 2, we check sum_ab.get(-2,0) which is 1. So contributes 1*1 (since sum_cd has 2 once? Wait, no. Wait, in sum_cd, for C and D, the sums would be same as A and B.\n\nWait, for C and D:\n\nc in C is [1, -1], same for D.\n\nsum_cd:\n\n1+1=2 (count 1), 1+(-1)=0 (count 2), (-1)+1=0, (-1)+(-1)=-2 (count 1).\n\nSo sum_cd is {2:1, 0:2, -2:1}.\n\nNow, for each sum t in sum_cd:\n\nWhen t=2, -t is -2. sum_ab[-2] is 1. So adds 1 * 1 (since sum_cd has t=2 once) → 1*1=1.\n\nWhen t=0, -t is 0. sum_ab[0] is 2. sum_cd has t=0 twice (count 2), so 2*2=4.\n\nWhen t=-2, -t is 2. sum_ab[2] is 1. sum_cd has t=-2 once, so 1*1=1.\n\nTotal count: 1 +4 +1 =6.\n\nLet's check manually.\n\nHow many tuples (i,j,k,l) where sum is 0.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\nEach list has two elements, so 16 total tuples.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations where sum is zero.\n\nFor example:\n\nA[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] =0.\n\nPossible sums from A+B: 2, 0, 0, -2.\n\nPossible sums from C+D: 2, 0, 0, -2.\n\nWe need (sum_ab) + (sum_cd) =0 → sum_ab = -sum_cd.\n\nSo for sum_ab=2, sum_cd must be -2. There's 1 sum_ab=2 and 1 sum_cd=-2 → 1*1=1 tuple.\n\nsum_ab=0: sum_cd=0. 2*2=4.\n\nsum_ab=-2: sum_cd=2. 1*1=1.\n\nTotal 6. Which matches the code's result.

Then do the same for C and D, and then for each sum in the first group, check if the negative of that sum exists in the second group. Because if a + b = x, then we need c + d = -x to make the total sum zero.\n\nLet me formalize that. Let's create a dictionary (or a hash map) where keys are the sums of a + b for all a in A and b in B, and the values are the counts of how many times each sum occurs.\n\nSimilarly, create another dictionary for c + d for all c in C and d in D.\n\nThen, for each sum x in the first dictionary, if -x is present in the second dictionary, multiply the counts from both dictionaries and add to the total.\n\nThis way, the time complexity would be O(n^2) for each pair, so overall O(n^2), which is much better than O(n^4). That's a common technique for these kinds of sum problems, like the 4Sum II problem on LeetCode.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. For example, if A and B each have n elements, then there are n^2 sums. Same for C and D. Then, looking up in the hash map is O(1) per operation, so the total time is O(n^2) for building the maps and O(n^2) for checking the pairs, which totals O(n^2).\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Create a dictionary for the sum of A and B.\n   For each a in A:\n      For each b in B:\n          sum_ab = a + b\n          increment the count for sum_ab in the dict.\n\n2. Similarly, create a dictionary for sum of C and D.\n\n3. Initialize a counter to 0.\n   For each sum_ab in dict1:\n       if -sum_ab is in dict2:\n           counter += dict1[sum_ab] * dict2[-sum_ab]\n\n4. Return the counter.\n\nWait, but what if some sums in dict2 don't have a corresponding -sum_ab? Then we just skip them.\n\nThis approach should correctly count all possible combinations where the four elements sum to zero.\n\nLet me test with a small example.\n\nSuppose A = [1], B = [-1], C = [0], D = [0].\n\nThen sum_ab is 0 (1 + (-1)), count 1.\n\nsum_cd is 0 + 0 = 0, count 1.\n\nLooking for -sum_ab which is 0, which exists in dict2. So total is 1*1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: A = [0,1], B = [0, -1], C = [0,1], D = [0, -1].\n\nsum_ab possibilities:\n\n0+0=0, 0 + (-1) = -1, 1+0=1, 1 + (-1)=0.\n\nSo dict1: 0:2, -1:1, 1:1.\n\nsum_cd:\n\n0+0=0, 0 + (-1) = -1, 1+0=1, 1 + (-1)=0.\n\ndict2: 0:2, -1:1, 1:1.\n\nNow, for each sum in dict1:\n\nsum_ab = 0: need 0 in dict2. 2*2=4.\n\nsum_ab = -1: need 1 in dict2. 1*1=1.\n\nsum_ab = 1: need -1 in dict2. 1*1=1.\n\nTotal is 4 +1 +1 =6.\n\nLet's count manually:\n\nPossible tuples where a + b + c + d =0.\n\nPossible a+b values:\n\n0, -1, 1, 0.\n\nFor each a+b=0: need c+d=0. There are 2 possibilities for a+b=0 (from A,B), and 2 for c+d=0. So 2*2=4.\n\nFor a+b=-1: need c+d=1. Which has 1 possibility. So 1*1=1.\n\nFor a+b=1: need c+d=-1. Which has 1 possibility. So 1*1=1.\n\nTotal 6. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, for the first two lists, A and B, create a Counter.\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict or Counter.\n\nWait, using Counter from collections.\n\nWait, in Python, we can do:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nsum_ab = Counter(a + b for a in A for b in B)\n\nSimilarly for sum_cd.\n\nThen, total = 0\n\nfor x, count in sum_ab.items():\n\n    total += count * sum_cd.get(-x, 0)\n\nWait, but sum_cd is a Counter for c + d.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, sum_cd would be Counter(c + d for c in C for d in D)\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef four_sum_count_zero(A, B, C, D):\n\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    sum_ab = Counter(a + b for a in A for b in B)\n\n    sum_cd = Counter(c +", "length_tokens": 1100}

The function is called four_sum_count_zero with four lists as inputs.\n\nLet me think. The brute force approach would be checking all possible combinations of the four indices. But that's O(n^4), which is way too slow for even moderate n. Like, if each list has 100 elements, 100^4 is 100 million, which might be manageable, but for 1000 elements, it's 1e12 operations, which is impossible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can split the problem into two parts. For example, compute all possible sums of A and B, then all possible sums of C and D, and then find pairs of sums that add up to zero.\n\nWait, right! Because A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] = 0 is equivalent to (A[i] + B[j]) = -(C[k] + D[l]). So if I can compute all possible sums from A and B, store them in a hash map with their counts, then for each sum from C and D, check how many times the negative of that sum exists in the first map.\n\nYes, that would reduce the time complexity. Let's see: for the first two lists, A and B, each of size n, there are n^2 possible sums. Similarly for C and D. So total time is O(n^2) for each part, which is O(n^2) overall, which is feasible for n up to 1000 (since 1e6 is manageable).\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Create a dictionary (or defaultdict) to store the sum of every pair from A and B, counting how many times each sum occurs.\n\n2. Iterate through all pairs in C and D, compute their sum, then check how many times the negative of that sum is present in the dictionary. Add that count to the result.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nLet me test this logic with a small example.\n\nSuppose A = [1, 2], B = [-1, -2], C = [3, 4], D = [-3, -4].\n\nPossible sums for A+B: 1 + (-1) = 0, 1 + (-2) = -1, 2 + (-1) = 1, 2 + (-2) = 0. So the counts are {0:2, -1:1, 1:1}.\n\nC+D sums: 3 + (-3) = 0, 3 + (-4) = -1, 4 + (-3) = 1, 4 + (-4) = 0. So the sums are 0, -1, 1, 0.\n\nFor each sum in C+D:\n\n- 0: need to find -0 = 0 in A+B. Count += 2 (since A+B has 0 twice)\n- -1: need 1. A+B has 1 once. Count +=1\n- 1: need -1. A+B has -1 once. Count +=1\n- 0: same as first, adds 2.\n\nTotal count is 2 +1 +1 +2 = 6. Let's check all possible tuples.\n\nWait, the correct tuples would be where A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] =0.\n\nBut according to the example:\n\nFor C+D sum 0 (from 3-3), the A+B sum needs to be 0. There are 2 possibilities in A+B (0 occurs twice). So 2 tuples here.\n\nSimilarly, for C+D sum -1 (3-4), need A+B sum to be 1, which occurs once. So 1 tuple.\n\nFor C+D sum 1 (4-3), need A+B sum -1, which occurs once. 1 tuple.\n\nFor C+D sum 0 (4-4), again 2 tuples.\n\nTotal 2+1+1+2=6. Which matches. So the logic seems correct.\n\nAnother example: if all four lists are [0], then the sum is 0+0+0+0=0. So the count should be 1. Let's see:\n\nA+B sums: 0+0=0, count 1.\n\nC+D sums: 0+0=0. For each sum (0), we look for -0=0 in the first map. So count +=1. Total 1. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the approach works.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, create a dictionary for the sum of A and B.\n\nWe can loop through each element in A and B, compute the sum, and increment the count in the dictionary.\n\nThen, loop through C and D, compute their sum, check if -sum is in the dictionary, and add the count.\n\nSo code steps:\n\n- Initialize a defaultdict(int) or a regular dict for the first part.\n\n- For a in A:\n   for b in B:\n      sum_ab = a + b\n      dict[sum_ab] +=1\n\n- Then, result =0\n  for c in C:\n     for d in D:\n         sum_cd = c + d\n         target = -sum_cd\n         if target in dict:\n             result += dict[target]\n\n- Return result.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nNow, check for possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if all elements are zero? Then for each pair in A and B, sum is 0. So the dict will have sum 0 with count n^2. Similarly for C and D, each sum is 0, so for each of n^2 pairs, we add n^2. So total count is n^4. Which is correct, since all combinations sum to zero.\n\nAnother case: A=[1], B=[1], C=[-1], D=[-1]. Then A+B sum is 2. C+D sum is -2. So target for sum_cd is 2 (since -(-2)=2). So count +=1.

Hmm.\n\nFirst, the brute force approach would be O(n^4), which is way too slow for large n. Like, if each list has 1000 elements, that's 1e12 operations. Definitely not feasible.\n\nSo I need a smarter way. Let's think about breaking it into two parts. Maybe split the four lists into two pairs. For example, compute all possible sums from A and B, and then all possible sums from C and D. Then for each sum in the first group, check if there's a corresponding sum in the second group that adds up to zero.\n\nWait, right. Let's say I compute all possible sums of A[i] + B[j] and store them in a dictionary where the key is the sum and the value is the count of how many times that sum occurs. Then, for each sum in C[k] + D[l], I check if the negative of that sum exists in the first dictionary. Because if (A[i] + B[j]) + (C[k] + D[l]) = 0, then (C[k] + D[l]) = - (A[i] + B[j]).\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Create a dictionary (or defaultdict) for the sums of A and B.\n   - For each a in A, each b in B, compute sum_ab = a + b, and increment the count for sum_ab.\n\n2. Initialize a counter to zero.\n3. For each c in C, each d in D:\n   - Compute sum_cd = c + d\n   - Check if -sum_cd exists in the dictionary. If yes, add the count from the dictionary to the counter.\n\nThis way, the time complexity is O(n^2) for building the first dictionary, and O(n^2) for checking the second part. So total O(n^2), which is manageable for n up to 1000 (since 1e6 operations is feasible).\n\nLet me test this logic with a small example.\n\nSuppose A = [1, -1], B = [0], C = [0], D = [0].\n\nPossible sums from A and B: 1+0=1, -1+0=-1. So the dictionary would have {1:1, -1:1}.\n\nNow for C and D: 0+0=0. So sum_cd is 0. We check for -0 which is 0. Wait, but the sum_ab needs to be -sum_cd. So sum_ab should be 0. But in the dictionary, there's no 0. So the count would be 0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the correct answer is 0 because none of the sums add up to zero. Wait, no. Wait, the tuples would be (i,j,k,l) where A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] =0.\n\nIn the example, C and D are both [0], so C[k] + D[l] is 0+0=0. So sum_ab needs to be 0. But in the dictionary, sum_ab is 1 and -1, so no matches. So the count is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: A = [1, 0], B = [-1, 0], C = [0], D = [0].\n\nSum_ab: 1 + (-1) = 0, 1+0=1, 0 + (-1) = -1, 0+0=0. So the dictionary would have 0:2, 1:1, -1:1.\n\nThen sum_cd is 0+0=0. So looking for -0=0. The count is 2. So total tuples would be 2.\n\nWhich makes sense: the tuples where (A[i], B[j]) are (1,-1) and (0,0), so two combinations. So yes, the count is 2.\n\nOkay, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, create a defaultdict for the sum_ab.\n\nWait, but using a dictionary. For example:\n\nsum_ab = {}\nfor a in A:\n    for b in B:\n        s = a + b\n        sum_ab[s] = sum_ab.get(s, 0) + 1\n\nThen, for C and D:\n\ncount = 0\nfor c in C:\n    for d in D:\n        s = c + d\n        count += sum_ab.get(-s, 0)\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nSo the function four_sum_count_zero would return count.\n\nLet me check edge cases.\n\nWhat if all elements are zero? Like A, B, C, D each have n elements of 0.\n\nThen sum_ab for all a, b is 0, so sum_ab[0] = n^2.\n\nsum_cd is 0 for all c, d. So for each of the n^2 combinations, we add sum_ab.get(0,0) which is n^2. So total count is n^2 * n^2 = n^4. Which is correct, since all possible tuples sum to zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when all lists are empty. But the problem says lists of integers, but perhaps n is zero. But the problem probably assumes non-empty lists, but in code, if all lists are empty, the loops would not run and return 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nThe function signature is four_sum_count_zero(A, B, C, D) -> int.\n\nSo:\n\ndef four_sum_count_zero(A, B, C, D):\n    sum_ab = {}\n    for a in A:\n        for b in B:\n            s = a + b\n            sum_ab[s] = sum_ab.get(s, 0) + 1\n ", "length_tokens": 1223}

Therefore, the count of states is the answer\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nclass State:\n    def __init__(self, link=-1, suffix_link=-1):\n        self.link = link\n        self.suffix_link = suffix_link\n        self.next = {}\n        self.suffix_count = 0\n\nclass SuffixAutomaton:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.states = [State()]  # Initial state\n        self.last_state = 0\n\n    def build(self, s: str):\n        for i, ch in enumerate(s):\n            state = self.states[self.last_state]\n            curr = len(self.states)\n            self.states.append(State(state.link, self.last_state))\n            self.states[curr].next[ch] = curr\n            self.states[curr].suffix_count = 1\n\n            while state.link!= -1 and ch not in self.states[state.link].next:\n                state = self.states[state.link]\n                self.states[curr].next[ch] = curr\n                self.states[curr].suffix_count += self.states[state.link].suffix_count\n                self.states[curr].link = self.states[state.link].suffix_link\n\n            curr_state = self.states[curr]\n            curr_link = self.states[curr].link\n            if curr_link!= -1:\n                self.states[curr_link].suffix_count += curr_state.suffix_count\n                curr_state.link = self.states[curr_link].link\n                curr_state.suffix_link = self.states[curr_link].suffix_link\n            else:\n                self.states[curr].link = -1\n                self.states[curr].suffix_link = curr\n                self.states[curr].suffix_count += curr_state.suffix_count\n                self.last_state = curr\n            state = self.states[self.last_state]\n\n    def count_states(self):\n        count = 0\n        for state in self.states:\n            if state.link!= -1:\n                count += 1\n        return count\n\ndef suffix_automaton_distinct_substrings(s: str) -> int:\n    automaton = SuffixAutomaton()\n    automaton.build(s)\n    return automaton.count_states()\n```\n\nThis implementation uses the well-known algorithm for constructing suffix automaton in linear time. It maintains a chain of states where each state represents either a suffix or a suffix group.\n\nThe count_states function traverses all states and returns the number of distinct states (which equals the number of distinct substrings).\n\nFinal answer: <Implement the above code>\n\n{\"final_answer\": \"<Implement the above code>\"}", "score": 0.05, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 260, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert suffix_automaton_distinct_substrings('ababa')==9"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}, "exec_traces": [{"test_index": 0, "returncode": 1, "stdout": "", "stderr": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/tmpw6cfwtn_.py\", line 53, in <module>\n    assert suffix_automaton_distinct_substrings('ababa')==9\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAssertionError\n"}]}

Brute force approach: try all possible combinations of i, j, k, l.\n   - This would be O(n^4) where n is the length of each list.\n   - This is feasible only for small lists.\n\n2. Using hash sets (or dictionaries): for each number in A, B, C, D, count the opposite number needed to make the sum zero.\n   - This approach is more efficient as it reduces the time complexity.\n   - For example, for A[i], we need B[j] + C[k] + D[l] = -A[i]\n   - We can precompute the needed numbers and use hash sets to count them.\n\n3.

For each number in A, we need to find three numbers in B, C, D such that their sum equals the negative of the number in A.\n\n2. We can precompute the required sums for each number in A using a hash map.\n\n3.

It starts with an initial solution and temperature T0. At each iteration, it perturbs the current solution (using a Gaussian step here), calculates the change in energy (which is f(x)), and decides whether to accept the new solution based on the Metropolis criterion.\n\nSo, steps for 1D:\n\n1.

Wait, maybe the standard deviation is proportional to T. Or maybe the step is generated as x_current + T * random.gauss(0, 1). Because as temperature decreases, the steps get smaller.

So for 1D, the new x is x_current + T * step, where step is a standard normal variable.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Gaussian steps\", so perhaps the step is drawn from a Gaussian distribution. The standard deviation might be fixed or depend on T. The problem statement isn't specific, but in standard SA, the step size often decreases with temperature. So using T as the standard deviation makes sense here. So the step is N(0, T), which would mean generating a random number with mean 0 and standard deviation T.\n\nWait, but in code, random.gauss(mu, sigma) takes mu and sigma. So if we do x_new = x_current + random.gauss(0, T), then the step has standard deviation T.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the step is scaled by a factor, but given the problem statement, I think using T as the sigma is the right approach here.\n\nSo for each iteration:\n\n- Generate x_new = x_current + random.gauss(0, T)\n- Compute delta = f(x_new) - f(x_current)\n- If delta < 0 (better solution), accept x_new.\n- Else, accept with probability exp(-delta / T)\n- If accepted, update x_current to x_new\n- Track the best x (the one with the lowest f value encountered)\n\nThen, after each iteration, cool the temperature: T = T * cooling.

I need to implement the simulated annealing optimization for a 1D function. The problem says it's in one dimension with Gaussian steps.

Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It starts with an initial solution and iteratively moves to neighboring solutions. The key idea is that it allows for some probability of accepting worse solutions to escape local minima, especially early on when the temperature is high.\n\nThe parameters given are:\n- f: the objective function to minimize (I assume it's minimization since it's common in optimization)\n- x0: initial guess\n- T0: initial temperature\n- cooling: cooling rate, which probably reduces the temperature each iteration\n- iters: number of iterations\n- seed: random seed for reproducibility\n\nThe task is to return the best x found during the process.\n\nSo, steps for the algorithm:\n\n1.

Wait, in standard simulated annealing, the step size can be adjusted based on temperature, but perhaps here they just use a Gaussian step with some fixed variance, but maybe scaled by T.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Gaussian steps\". So perhaps the new position is generated as x_new = x_current + random.gauss(0, T), since temperature often controls the step size. But the exact step generation isn't specified. Alternatively, maybe the step is scaled by T. Let me think. In some implementations, the step size decreases as temperature decreases, but maybe here the step is drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation proportional to T. Let me check common practices.\n\nIn simulated annealing, the neighborhood function can vary. For continuous variables, a common approach is to use a normal distribution with standard deviation proportional to the current temperature. So perhaps the step is x_new = x_current + T * random.gauss(0, 1). That way, as T cools down, the steps become smaller.\n\nSo the step would be generated using a Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation equal to T. Wait, but maybe the problem expects a different scaling. The problem statement just says \"Gaussian steps\", so maybe the standard deviation is 1, but that doesn't make sense because as temperature decreases, you want smaller steps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the step size is fixed, but the acceptance probability depends on T. Wait, no, the step generation is part of the algorithm. Let me think again. In the standard simulated annealing for continuous functions, the neighborhood is often defined as a random perturbation, which can be Gaussian with a variance that may or may not depend on temperature.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"with Gaussian steps\", so perhaps the step is generated as a Gaussian random variable. The exact parameters (mean and variance) are not specified, but in many SA implementations, the step size is scaled by the current temperature. So for example, the new x is x_current + delta, where delta ~ N(0, T). So the standard deviation is T. That way, as T decreases, the steps become smaller.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the step is scaled by T multiplied by some constant, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that the standard deviation is proportional to T. Let's go with delta = random.gauss(0, T), so the step size is scaled by T.\n\nWait, but in 1D, the step is a scalar.

So after iters steps, T = T0 * cooling^iters.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Initialize x_best = x0, f_best = f(x0)\n- Current x = x0\n- For each iteration in range(iters):\n   - Current temperature T = T0 * (cooling)^iteration\n   - Generate a new x_new = x + random.gauss(0, T)  [since Gaussian step with std T]\n   - Compute delta = f(x_new) - f(x)\n   - If delta < 0 (better solution), accept x_new\n   - Else, accept with probability exp(-delta / T)\n   - If accepted, update x to x_new\n   - If f(x_new) is better than f_best, update x_best and f_best\n- Return x_best\n\nWait, but the step size: is the standard deviation of the Gaussian step equal to T? That's a common approach. Because as T decreases, the steps get smaller, allowing for finer exploration.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So in each iteration, the proposal is x_new = x + N(0, T).\n\nWait, but in some implementations, the step size is fixed, and the temperature only affects the acceptance probability. However, the problem states \"Gaussian steps\", which probably refers to the proposal distribution being Gaussian with standard deviation proportional to the temperature.

I need to implement a simulated annealing optimizer for a 1D function. The function signature is given: f, x0, T0, cooling, iters, seed. It should return the best x found.\n\nFirst, I remember that simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It's inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. So, the idea is to start with a high temperature and gradually cool it down, allowing the algorithm to escape local minima by sometimes accepting worse solutions.\n\nIn 1D, the state is just a single float x. The algorithm starts at x0. For each iteration, we generate a new candidate by perturbing the current x. The problem mentions Gaussian steps, so the perturbation should be a random number from a normal distribution. Wait, but in 1D, a Gaussian step would be adding a random value with mean 0 and some standard deviation. But the problem doesn't specify the standard deviation. Hmm. Maybe it's fixed, like step size? Or perhaps the standard deviation is related to the temperature? Wait, in some implementations, the step size might be proportional to the temperature. Or maybe the step is generated using a normal distribution with standard deviation that's a parameter. Wait, the problem statement says \"Gaussian steps\", so perhaps each step is x_new = x_current + N(0, 1) * step_size? But the problem doesn't mention a step size parameter. Wait, the parameters given are T0, cooling, iters, seed. So maybe the step size is fixed, or maybe the standard deviation of the Gaussian is proportional to the current temperature.\n\nWait, in some SA implementations, the step size might decrease as the temperature decreases. For example, the standard deviation of the Gaussian could be proportional to the current temperature. Let me think. Let's check the problem statement again: \"SA in 1D with Gaussian steps\". So the step is generated by a Gaussian distribution. But the exact parameters (mean and variance) aren't specified. Maybe the standard deviation is fixed, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the step is generated as x_new = x + random.gauss(0, 1) * something. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention a step size parameter. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps in this problem, the Gaussian step has a standard deviation of 1, but scaled by the current temperature. Or maybe the step size is fixed, but the acceptance probability depends on temperature. Let me recall the standard SA steps.\n\nThe general steps are:\n\n1. Initialize x to x0, T to T0.\n2. For each iteration:\n   a. Generate a new candidate x_new by perturbing x (using Gaussian steps here).\n   b. Compute delta = f(x_new) - f(x).\n   c. If delta < 0 (better solution), accept x_new.\n   d. Else, accept with probability exp(-delta / T).\n   e. Update T by multiplying with cooling factor (T = T * cooling).\n3. Track the best solution found so far.\n\nWait, but the cooling schedule here is probably multiplicative: T_{k+1} = cooling * T_k. So cooling is a factor less than 1, like 0.95.\n\nNow, the Gaussian step: in 1D, the perturbation is a random number from a normal distribution. But what's the variance? The problem says \"Gaussian steps\", but doesn't specify parameters. Maybe the standard deviation is 1.0, but perhaps it's scaled by the current temperature. Wait, in some implementations, the step size is proportional to the temperature. For example, the standard deviation of the Gaussian could be T. But I'm not sure. The problem statement is a bit vague here.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Gaussian steps\", so perhaps the step is generated as x_new = x + random.gauss(0, 1) * step_size. But since step_size isn't a parameter, maybe step_size is 1.0. Alternatively, maybe the standard deviation is T. Let me think. If T is high, the steps are larger, which makes sense because at high temperatures, you want to explore more. As T decreases, steps become smaller. So maybe the standard deviation of the Gaussian is proportional to T. For example, step = random.gauss(0, T).

For each subset, we track the number of ways to arrange the nodes in that subset such that the ordering is a valid topological sort up to that point.\n\nThe key idea is that a valid topological sort for a subset S must end with a node that has all its predecessors (in the entire graph) already included in S (except possibly itself). Wait, no: when building the ordering, each node added must have all its in-neighbors (parents) already in the subset before adding it. So for a given subset S, the nodes that can be added next are those in S whose in-degree within the subgraph induced by S is zero. Wait, no: the in-degree in the entire graph, but only considering the nodes not yet added.

So for v to be a valid next node, all in-neighbors of v must be in S.\n\nSo the recurrence is: dp[S] = sum over all v not in S where all predecessors of v are in S of dp[S ∪ {v}].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the DP state is usually the number of ways to arrange the nodes in S into a valid topological order. So when building up S, for each S, dp[S] is the count. To compute dp[S], we look at all possible last elements v in S, such that when we remove v from S, the remaining subset S' = S \\ {v} has a valid topological order, and v has no incoming edges from outside S' (i.e., all predecessors of v are in S').\n\nWait, more accurately, for S to have a valid topological order ending with v, all predecessors of v must be in S' (since S' is S without v). So for each S, dp[S] = sum_{v in S where (in_degree of v in S is 0)} dp[S \\ {v}].\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of building the ordering from the beginning. Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nThe standard approach for counting topological sorts via DP over subsets:\n\n- dp[mask] represents the number of topological orderings for the subset of nodes represented by mask.\n\n- To compute dp[mask], we consider which node was added last. For each node v in mask, if all of v's predecessors (in the original graph) are also in mask (but wait, no: predecessors must be in mask except v itself?), no. Wait, when adding v as the last node in the ordering for mask, all predecessors of v must have been added before v. So all predecessors of v must be in mask \\ {v}.\n\nThus, for each mask, dp[mask] is the sum over all v in mask where (predecessors of v are subset of mask \\ {v}) of dp[mask without v].\n\nBase case: dp[0] = 1 (empty set has one ordering).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1.

Suppose the last node is v. Then the previous state is mask without v, and v must have all its in-neighbors in the previous state (mask without v).\n\nWait, that's another way to model it. So for each mask, dp[mask] = sum over all v in mask where (all predecessors of v are in mask \\ {v}) of dp[mask \\ {v}].\n\nYes, that's correct.

The string is ) ( ) ( ) ). Let's index each character:\n\n0: )\n1: (\n2: )\n3: (\n4: )\n5: )\n\nLooking for the longest valid substring. Let's see possible substrings:\n\nFrom index 1-2: \"()\", which is length 2.\n\nFrom index 3-4: \"()\", length 2.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a longer one. Wait, the substring from 1-4 is \"()()\", which is valid. Let's check: positions 1 is '(', 2 is ')', 3 is '(', 4 is ')'. So that's two pairs, length 4. Then the next character is 5, which is ')', but there's no opening for it. So the longest is 4. So the answer for ')()())' should be 4. Wait, but let me confirm.\n\nWait the input is ')()())' which is 6 characters. Let's list all possible valid substrings:\n\n- At positions 1-2: \"()\", length 2.\n\n- Positions 3-4: \"()\", length 2.\n\nBut positions 1-4: \"()()\", which is valid, length 4.\n\nAlso, positions 2-5: \")(()\" but that starts with a ')', so invalid. Wait no, positions 1-4 is indices 1 to 4 inclusive. Let's see:\n\nIndices 1: '(', 2: ')', 3: '(', 4: ')', so yes, \"()()\", valid. So length 4.\n\nIs there any longer? Let's see. The entire string is )()()), which starts with a ')', so the first character is invalid. The substring from 0-1 is ')(', invalid. So the longest is 4. So the function should return 4 for this input.\n\nNow, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nI remember that this is a classic dynamic programming problem, or can be solved using a stack.\n\nLet me think of possible approaches.\n\nApproach 1: Using a stack. The idea is to track indices of opening parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, pop from the stack. If the stack becomes empty, push the current index as a new starting point. Otherwise, compute the current valid length as current index minus the top of the stack.\n\nWait, the standard approach for this problem uses a stack where we push -1 as the initial index. Then, for each character:\n\n- If it's '(', push the index.\n\n- If it's ')', pop from the stack.\n\n   - If stack is empty after pop, push current index (as a new starting point for the next valid substring).\n\n   - Else, current length is current index - stack's top.\n\nWe keep track of the maximum length.\n\nLet me test this approach with the example.\n\nExample: s = ')()())', indices 0-5.\n\nInitialize stack with -1.\n\ncurrent max_len = 0.\n\ni=0: character ')'\n\nstack is [-1], pop gives -1. Now stack is empty. Push 0. Stack is [0].\n\nmax_len remains 0.\n\ni=1: '('\n\npush 1. Stack [0,1]\n\ni=2: ')'\n\npop from stack. Now stack is [0]. Current index 2. Length is 2 - 0 = 2. max_len becomes 2.\n\ni=3: '('\n\npush 3. Stack [0,3]\n\ni=4: ')'\n\npop. Stack becomes [0]. Length 4-0=4. max_len=4.\n\ni=5: ')'\n\npop from stack (stack is [0], pop gives 0. Now stack is empty. Push 5. Stack [5].\n\nSo max_len is 4. Which matches the expected result.\n\nAnother test case: s = '()(())'\n\nIndices 0-5:\n\n0: '(' → stack [ -1, 0 ]\n\n1: ')' → pop to -1, length 1 - (-1) = 2. max_len=2.\n\n2: '(' → stack [ -1, 2 ]\n\n3: '(' → stack [ -1, 2, 3 ]\n\n4: ')' → pop to 2, length 4-2=2. max_len=2.\n\n5: ')' → pop to -1, length 5 - (-1) =6. max_len=6.\n\nWait, but the string is '()(())' which is valid entire string, length 6. So yes.\n\nAnother example: s = '()'\n\nstack starts with -1.\n\ni=0: '(', stack [ -1, 0 ]\n\ni=1: ')', pop to -1, length 1 - (-1) =2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize stack with -1.\n\nmax_len = 0.\n\nFor i in 0 to len(s)-1:\n\n   if s[i] == '(':\n\n       stack.append(i)\n\n   else:\n\n       stack.pop()\n\n       if stack is empty:\n\n           stack.append(i)\n\n       else:\n\n           current_length = i", "length_tokens": 2063}

So the answer for the example should be 4.\n\nNow, how to compute this programmatically.\n\nI remember that dynamic programming is a common approach for this problem. Let's think about the DP approach.\n\nThe idea is to use a DP array where dp[i] represents the length of the longest valid substring ending at index i.\n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 0 since a single parenthesis can't be valid.\n\nFor each i from 1 to len(s)-1:\n\n- If s[i] is '(', then dp[i] = 0 because a closing bracket is needed.\n- If s[i] is ')':\n   - Check the previous character (i-1):\n      - If s[i-1] is '(', then dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 2 (if i >= 2, else 2)\n      - If s[i-1] is ')', then check if the character before the valid substring ending at i-1 is '('. So look at s[i - dp[i-1] - 1]. If that's '(', then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 + dp[i - dp[i-1] - 2]\n\nWait, maybe I need to formalize this.\n\nLet me think through the steps.\n\nFor example, in the string '()()':\n\nIndices 0: '(', 1: ')', 2: '(', 3: ')'\n\ndp[1] = 2 (for '()')\ndp[3] = dp[2-1 (which is 1) ] + 2? Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nAnother common method is to use a stack.

Or maybe using a stack. Let me think. Oh right, one common method is to use a stack where you track indices of parentheses.

Let me recall how suffix automata work.\n\nFirst, I remember that a suffix automaton is a powerful data structure for string processing. One of its key properties is that it can efficiently count the number of distinct substrings in a string. The idea is that each state in the SAM represents a set of substrings that have the same end positions. The number of distinct substrings can be calculated by summing up the differences between the maximum and minimum lengths of the substrings represented by each state.\n\nWait, more precisely, for each state in the SAM (excluding the initial state), the number of distinct substrings contributed by that state is (state.length - state.link.length). Because the state's length is the maximum length of the substrings it represents, and the link's length is the maximum length of the substrings in the previous state (the suffix link). So the difference gives the number of new substrings added when this state was created.\n\nSo the total number of distinct substrings is the sum over all states (except the initial) of (len - link.len). Let me verify this.\n\nYes, for example, if a state has a max length of 5 and its suffix link's max length is 3, then this state contributes 5 - 3 = 2 new substrings. Because the substrings of length 4 and 5 are unique to this state.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Build the suffix automaton for the input string s.\n2. Traverse all states (except the initial state) and sum (state.length - state.link.length).\n\nNow, how to build the SAM?\n\nThe SAM is built incrementally. Each state has:\n- length: the length of the longest substring in the state.\n- link: the suffix link.\n- next: a dictionary of transitions (char -> state).\n\nThe initial state (state 0) has length 0 and link to -1 (or None).\n\nWe start with the initial state, and then process each character of the string one by one.\n\nThe standard algorithm for building the SAM involves maintaining a last state, which is the state after adding the previous character.\n\nWhen adding a new character c:\n- Create a new state cur with length = last.length + 1.\n- Traverse back from last via suffix links until we find a state p that has a transition on c, or reach the root.\n- If no such state p exists, set cur's link to the initial state (0).\n- Else, let q be the state p.next[c].\n  - If q.length == p.length + 1, then cur's link is q.\n  - Else, we need to clone q: create a new state clone, copy q's next and link, set clone.length = p.length + 1. Then update q's link and cur's link to clone. Also, backtrack from p via suffix links and fix transitions to q that should point to clone.\n\nAfter building the SAM, sum (state.length - state.link.length) for all states except the initial.\n\nWait, but the initial state (state 0) has link as -1 (or None), so we have to skip it. Also, when summing, for each state that has a valid link (i.e., not -1), we compute the difference.\n\nLet me think of a small example.

Let me recall how suffix automata work.\n\nFirst, the suffix automaton (SAM) is a finite automaton that captures all substrings of a given string. Each state in the SAM represents a set of end positions for certain substrings. The key properties are that the number of distinct substrings can be derived from the SAM structure.\n\nI remember that in a SAM, each state has a 'len' which is the length of the longest string in that state. Also, there's a 'link' which points to the state of the longest suffix that appears in another state.\n\nThe formula for the number of distinct substrings is the sum over all states (except the initial one) of (state.len - state.link.len). Wait, no, maybe it's the sum of (current state's len - its link's len) for all states. Because each state contributes the number of new substrings that end at that state.\n\nLet me think. For example, the initial state (state 0) has len 0. Then when we add characters, each new state contributes (current.len - link.len) new substrings. So the total distinct substrings would be the sum of (st.len - st.link.len) for all states except the start state? Or including?\n\nWait, the start state (state 0) has len 0, and its link is maybe itself? No, the link of the start state is usually -1 or null, but in some implementations, the start state's link is null. Wait, perhaps the initial state (state 0) is the root, and when you create new states, their links point to other states.\n\nWait, the standard way to compute the number of distinct substrings using SAM is to note that each state corresponds to a set of substrings that are suffixes of each other. The number of distinct substrings contributed by a state is (len(state) - len(link(state))). Because the link state's len is the length of the longest suffix of the current state's strings that is in another state. So the current state's strings range from (link.len + 1) to len, so the count is len - link.len.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct substrings is the sum over all states (except the start state?) of (len - link.len). Wait, but the start state may have len 0, so if we include it, it would contribute 0. So maybe the sum over all states (including start) would be the same as sum over all states except start. Wait, let's see.\n\nFor example, take the string \"a\". The SAM would have states:\n\n- State 0: initial, len 0, link -1 (or null)\n- State 1: created when adding 'a', len 1, link to state 0.\n\nSo sum would be (1 - 0) = 1, which is correct (substrings: \"a\").\n\nAnother example: \"ab\". Let's see.\n\nAfter processing 'a', state 1 as before.\n\nProcessing 'b':\n\n- Current state is 1. Create state 2 with len 2.\n\nWait, maybe I need to step through building the SAM for \"ab\".\n\nBut perhaps the formula is that the total number of distinct substrings is the sum for each state (except the initial) of (len - link.len). Wait, in the \"a\" example, sum is 1 (state 1: 1-0=1), which is correct.

I need to implement a function called suffix_automaton_distinct_substrings that takes a string s and returns the number of distinct substrings. The problem specifies using a suffix automaton (SAM). Hmm, right, suffix automata can efficiently count distinct substrings.\n\nFirst, I remember that a suffix automaton is a finite automaton that captures all substrings of a given string. Each state in the SAM represents some set of substrings, and transitions between states represent adding characters. The key property here is that the number of distinct substrings can be calculated by summing the differences in the 'length' values of the states.\n\nWait, how does that work? Let me recall. In a SAM, each state has a 'len' attribute which is the length of the longest string in that state. When building the SAM, each new state (except the initial one) is created during the extension process. For each state, the number of distinct substrings that end at that state is len(state) - len(link(state)), where link is the suffix link.\n\nSo the total number of distinct substrings would be the sum over all states (except the initial one, maybe) of (len(state) - len(link(state))). Because each state contributes the number of new substrings that are added when that state is created.\n\nWait, let's think. The initial state (state 0) probably has len 0. Then, as we add each character, we create new states. For example, when building the SAM for \"ab\", the distinct substrings are \"a\", \"b\", \"ab\", so 3. Let's see how the formula works.\n\nBut maybe I should look up the standard approach. Oh right, the standard formula for the number of distinct substrings using SAM is the sum for all states (excluding the root) of (st[state].length - st[st[state].link].length). Because each state's contribution is the number of new substrings that are added when that state is created, which is the difference between its max length and its suffix link's max length.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Build the SAM for the input string s.\n2. For each state in the SAM (excluding the initial state), compute len(state) - len(link(state)).\n3. Sum all these values to get the total number of distinct substrings.\n\nWait, but how does the SAM construction work? Let's outline the steps.\n\nThe SAM construction uses a few key variables:\n\n- last: the current state after processing each character.\n- states: a list of states, each state has:\n   - len: the length of the longest substring in the state.\n   - link: the suffix link.\n   - next: a dictionary of transitions.\n\nThe steps to build the SAM:\n\nInitialize with state 0 (root), len 0, link -1 (maybe).\n\nThen for each character c in s:\n\n   create a new state cur with len = last.len + 1.\n   let p = last; while p is not -1 and doesn't have transition on c, set p.next[c] = cur, p = p.link.\n   if p is -1, then cur's link is 0.\n   else:\n        q = p.next[c]\n        if q.len == p.len + 1, then cur's link is q.\n        else:\n            clone q into a new state clone, with len = p.len +1.\n            copy q's next and link to clone.\n            set q.link = clone and cur.link = clone.\n            while p != -1 and p.next[c] == q, set p.next[c] = clone, p = p.link.\n   last = cur.\n\nWait, but during the construction, each time we create a new state (cur or clone), we can track the contributions.\n\nBut for the purpose of counting distinct substrings, after building the SAM, we need to sum (st[i].len - st[st[i].link].len) for all i >= 1 (assuming state 0 is root).\n\nWait, for example, for the string \"a\", the SAM has states:\n\nState 0: len 0, link -1 (but maybe link is 0?

Let me recall how suffix automata work for counting distinct substrings.\n\nFirst, the suffix automaton (SAM) is a finite automaton that recognizes all suffixes of a string. One of the key properties is that the number of distinct substrings can be calculated by summing up the number of distinct paths starting from the initial state. Each state in the SAM represents some set of substrings, and the transitions between states represent extending those substrings.\n\nWait, another way I remember is that for each state (except the initial one), the number of distinct substrings ending at that state is (length of the state - length of its link's state). So the total distinct substrings would be the sum over all states (except the initial) of (len(state) - len(link(state))).\n\nLet me confirm that. The SAM construction has each state with a 'length' which is the length of the longest string in that state. The suffix link points to the state with the longest suffix of that string which is in another state. So for each state, the number of new distinct substrings contributed is (current state's length - the suffix link's length). Because the state represents all substrings from (link's length + 1) up to current length. So summing these differences across all states gives the total distinct substrings.\n\nYes, for example, if a state has length 5 and its suffix link's state has length 3, then this state contributes 5 - 3 = 2 new substrings. Wait, no: the state's longest string is length 5, and the suffix link points to the state with longest string length 3. So the substrings that end at this state are of lengths 4 and 5 (since 3+1 to 5). Wait, no, maybe it's the difference in lengths. So 5 - 3 = 2, which would mean two new substrings. But actually, the number of distinct substrings contributed by the state is (len - link.len). Because the state's substrings are all the suffixes of the longest string that are longer than the link's longest string. So for example, if the longest string in the state is 'abcd' (len 4), and the link's longest is 'bc' (len 2), then the substrings added are 'cd', 'bcd', 'abcd'? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the direction.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of distinct substrings is equal to the sum for each state of (state.length - state.link.length). Because each state represents a set of substrings that are suffixes of the longest one, and the number of new substrings added when this state was created is the difference between its length and the link's length.\n\nSo for the entire SAM, after building it, the total distinct substrings would be the sum of (st.length - st.link.length) for all states except the initial one (since the initial state's link is null, but maybe the initial state doesn't contribute anything).\n\nWait, the initial state (state 0) usually has length 0 and its link is None. So when we sum over all states except the initial, but maybe the initial state isn't counted. Let's think with a simple example.\n\nTake the string \"a\". The SAM would have:\n\n- State 0: initial, len 0, link to -1 (null)\n- State 1: len 1, link to 0.\n\nThe distinct substrings are \"a\", so count is 1. Sum is (1 - 0) = 1.

For each of these numbers, find the pair of divisors that are closest together. Then compare the two pairs (from n+1 and n+2) and choose the one with the smallest difference.\n\nWait, but how do I find the closest divisors for a number? Well, the closest divisors of a number m would be around the square root of m. Because if you have a number m, the pair of factors that are closest to each other will be around sqrt(m). So for each m (which is either n+1 or n+2), I can start checking from the integer part of sqrt(m) downwards until I find a divisor.\n\nLet me think. For example, if m is 10, sqrt(10) is about 3.16. So check 3: 10 divided by 3 is 3.333... not integer. Then check 2: 10/2=5. So the pair is (2,5), difference is 3. But wait, 1 and 10 is also a pair, but their difference is 9, which is bigger. So the closest pair is indeed (2,5).\n\nWait, but maybe for some numbers, like perfect squares. For m=16, sqrt is 4, so 4*4=16, which is the closest possible.\n\nSo the approach is: for each m (n+1 and n+2), find the largest divisor of m that is less than or equal to sqrt(m). Then the pair would be (divisor, m/divisor). The difference between them would be m/divisor - divisor. We need the pair with the smallest difference.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. For m1 = n+1 and m2 = n+2:\n   a. Find the closest divisor pair for m1.\n   b. Find the closest divisor pair for m2.\n2. Compare the two pairs (from m1 and m2) based on how close the two numbers are (i.e., the smaller the difference between the two numbers, the better).\n3. Return the pair with the smallest difference.

The first divisor we find will give the pair (d, m//d), and since we're starting from sqrt(m) downwards, the first d that divides m will be the largest possible d <= sqrt(m), so m//d will be the smallest possible >= sqrt(m). Therefore, the difference (m//d - d) will be minimized.\n\nYes. So for example, m=15. sqrt(15) is ~3.872. Check 3: 15/3=5, which is integer. So pair (3,5), difference 2. Which is the closest possible.\n\nAnother example: m=12. sqrt is ~3.464. Check 3: 12/3=4, so (3,4), difference 1. Which is the closest.\n\nSo the algorithm for a given m is:\n\n- Compute sqrt_m = int(math.isqrt(m))\n- Iterate d from sqrt_m down to 1:\n   - if m % d == 0:\n      return (d, m//d)\n\nSo for each m, this gives the closest pair.\n\nThen, for the problem, we compute the closest pair for m1 = n+1 and m2 = n+2, then compare which pair has the smaller difference (i.e., (b - a) for (a, b)), and return the pair with the smaller difference. If the differences are equal, then perhaps either is acceptable, but according to the problem statement, it's possible that both m1 and m2 have pairs with the same difference. The problem says \"closest\", so we need to choose the pair where the two numbers are closest. If both pairs have same difference, perhaps the problem expects either, but the problem statement says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So if both options are equally close, then either is acceptable.

Also, among all possible pairs for both n+1 and n+2, I need the pair that's closest to each other (i.e., the two numbers have the smallest absolute difference).\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem. For a given n, compute n+1 and n+2. For each of those two numbers (let's call them m1 = n+1 and m2 = n+2), find all possible pairs of divisors (a, b) such that a * b = m.

Because the pair of divisors closest to each other are the ones where a is as large as possible without exceeding sqrt(m). For example, for m=12, sqrt(12) is ~3.464. The divisors are (1,12), (2,6), (3,4). The closest pair is (3,4) with difference 1.\n\nSo the approach for each m is to iterate from the integer part of sqrt(m) downwards, and check if m is divisible by i. The first i where m % i == 0 will give the pair (i, m//i), which is the closest possible pair for m.\n\nYes, because as we go down from sqrt(m), the first divisor we find will pair with the smallest possible quotient, hence the two numbers will be closest.\n\nSo for each m (n+1 and n+2), compute the closest pair, then compare the two pairs (from m1 and m2) and return the one with the smaller difference.\n\nLet's test with an example.

Check 3: 10%3=1. 2: 10%2=0, so pair (2,5), difference 3.\n\nSo the closest pair is (3,3) from 9. So the function should return (3,3).\n\nAnother example: n=1. Then n+1=2, n+2=3.\n\nFor 2: closest pair (1,2), difference 1.\n\nFor 3: (1,3), difference 2.\n\nSo return (1,2).\n\nAnother example: n=5. n+1=6, n+2=7.\n\nFor 6: sqrt(6) ~2.45.

The task is to define a function closest_divisors(n) that returns a tuple of two integers whose product is either n+1 or n+2, and these two integers are as close to each other as possible.\n\nHmm, so for a given n, we need to check both n+1 and n+2. For each of these numbers, find the pair of divisors that are closest to each other (i.e., the pair with the smallest difference), and then compare the two pairs from n+1 and n+2 to see which one is closer.\n\nWait, right. Because the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So we have to check both possibilities (n+1 and n+2), find the closest pair for each, then pick the pair with the smaller difference between the two numbers.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to find the closest divisors for a given number m. For a number m, the closest divisors would be around the square root of m. Because the square root is where the two factors are equal (if m is a perfect square), so the closest pair would be the factors around sqrt(m).\n\nSo for a number m, to find the closest divisors:\n\n1. Compute the integer square root of m, let's say s = int(sqrt(m)).\n2. Then check from s downwards to 1 to find the largest divisor of m that's less than or equal to s.\n3. Once found, the pair would be (d, m//d), where d is that divisor.\n\nFor example, if m is 10, sqrt(10) is ~3.16. So s is 3. Check 3: 10 % 3 is 1, not a divisor. Then 2: 10 % 2 is 0. So the pair is (2,5), difference 3. But if m is 12, sqrt(12) is ~3.46. Check 3: 12%3=0, so pair (3,4), difference 1.\n\nSo the plan is: for each candidate m (n+1 and n+2), find the closest divisor pair, then compare the differences between the two candidates.\n\nSo the steps for the function:\n\n- For m1 = n+1 and m2 = n+2:\n   - For each m, find the closest divisor pair (a, b) where a <= b and a*b = m.\n- Compare the differences (b1 - a1) and (b2 - a2) for the two pairs.\n- Return the pair with the smaller difference. If they are equal, perhaps return either? But the problem says \"closest\", so if both have same difference, maybe either is acceptable. But probably, we need to check which one has the smaller maximum or something, but the problem states \"closest\" which is determined by the difference.\n\nWait, the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So among all possible pairs for n+1 and n+2, find the pair with the minimal difference.\n\nSo for each m in [n+1, n+2], find the pair with minimal difference, then pick between the two.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nFor each m in (n+1, n+2):\n\n   Find the pair (a, b) where a <= b, a*b = m, and b - a is minimized.\n\nCompare the two pairs (from m1 and m2), select the one with the smaller difference.\n\nNow, how to implement finding the closest divisors for a given m.\n\nAs I thought before, start from the integer square root and go downwards.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef find_closest_pair(m):\n    s = int(math.isqrt(m))\n    for i in range(s, 0, -1):\n        if m % i == 0:\n            return (i, m // i)\n    # But m is at least 1, so this should not happen. For m=1, returns (1,1).\n\nWait, but for m=1, the pair is (1,1). For m=2, s is 1, 2%1=0, so (1,2).\n\nYes. So this function would work.\n\nSo for each m, find the pair by starting at sqrt(m) and going down.\n\nSo the steps for the main function:\n\nCompute m1 = n+1, m2 = n+2.\n\nFind pair1 = find_closest_pair(m1)\n\nFind pair2 = find_closest_pair(m2)\n\nCompute diff1 = pair1[1] - pair1[0]\n\ndiff2 = pair2[1] - pair2[0]\n\nReturn the pair with the smaller diff. If diff1 == diff2, return either? Wait, but which one to choose? The problem says \"closest\", so if both have same difference, perhaps either is acceptable. But perhaps the problem expects to prefer n+1 or n+2? Wait, the problem statement says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So if both pairs have the same difference, which one to return?\n\nLooking at the problem statement again: \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So it's possible that for some n, both n+1 and n+2 have pairs with same minimal difference.

I need to define a function called closest_divisors that takes an integer n and returns a tuple of two integers. These two integers should be divisors of either n+1 or n+2, and their product must equal either n+1 or n+2. The key is that they have to be the closest possible pair, meaning their difference is as small as possible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"closest\" means here. For any number, the pair of divisors that are closest to each other would be around the square root of that number. Because if you have a number m, the divisors a and b where a ≤ b and a*b = m, the smallest difference between a and b occurs when a is as close as possible to sqrt(m). So for each candidate number (n+1 and n+2), I should find the pair of divisors closest to each other and then compare which of the two candidates (n+1 or n+2) has the pair with the smaller difference.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For m in [n+1, n+2], find the pair of divisors (a, b) such that a * b = m and a ≤ b, and b - a is minimized.\n2. Compare the two pairs (from m = n+1 and m = n+2) and choose the one with the smallest difference.

Then we should return the pair from n+2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each m in [n+1, n+2]:\n\n- Find the largest a ≤ sqrt(m) such that a divides m. Then b = m/a. The pair (a, b) will have the smallest possible difference for m.\n\nThen, between the two pairs (from m1 = n+1 and m2 = n+2), select the pair with the smaller (b - a). If the differences are equal, perhaps choose the pair from the smaller m? Wait, the problem says \"closest\", so the difference is the key. If differences are equal, then either is acceptable, but the problem says \"the closest\", so maybe the problem expects to pick the first one? Wait, no, the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So whichever pair (from n+1 or n+2) has the minimal possible difference. If both have same difference, then perhaps the problem allows either, but the problem says \"closest\", so maybe the first occurrence? Wait, the problem statement isn't specific, but perhaps the test cases will have a clear answer.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each candidate m (n+1 and n+2):\n\n- iterate from int(sqrt(m)) down to 1, and check if m is divisible by i. The first such i found will give the pair (i, m//i), which has the smallest possible difference for m.\n\nThen compare the two pairs (from m1 and m2) based on their differences (b - a), and return the pair with the smaller difference. If the differences are equal, perhaps return the pair from the smaller m? Or maybe it doesn't matter. Let's check an example.\n\nTake n = 8. Then m1 = 9, m2 = 10.\n\nFor m1=9: sqrt(9) is 3. 9/3=3. So pair (3,3), difference 0.\n\nFor m2=10: sqrt(10) is ~3.16. Check 3: 10/3 is 3.333, not integer. Next 2: 10/2=5. So pair (2,5), difference 3.\n\nSo the closest is (3,3), so return (3,3).\n\nAnother example: n=1. m1=2, m2=3.\n\nFor m1=2: sqrt(2) ~1.414. Check 1: 2/1=2. Pair (1,2), difference 1.\n\nFor m2=3: same, (1,3), difference 2. So return (1,2).\n\nAnother example: n=5. m1=6, m2=7.\n\nm1=6: sqrt(6) ~2.45. Check 2: 6/2=3. Pair (2,3), difference 1.\n\nm2=7: prime, so (1,7), difference 6. So return (2,3).\n\nAnother example where both m1 and m2 have same difference.

I need to define an LRUCache2 with get and put methods, similar to the classic LRU cache. First, I should recall how an LRU cache works. The main idea is that when the cache reaches its capacity, the least recently used item is evicted.\n\nSo, the classic approach uses a combination of a hash map (dictionary) and a doubly linked list.

Yes, in Python, using OrderedDict can simplify the implementation since it maintains the insertion order. For get, if the key exists, we move it to the end (to mark as most recently used), and for put, if the key exists, we update it and move to end; if not, add it, and if over capacity, pop the first item (since OrderedDict's popitem with last=False removes the oldest).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"classic LRU\", so maybe they expect the traditional doubly linked list approach.

The dictionary allows O(1) access to the nodes, and the doubly linked list helps in maintaining the order of usage, so we can quickly move the most recently used items to the front and evict from the end.\n\nWait, but in Python, there's also the OrderedDict from the collections module, which can be used to simulate the LRU behavior by moving items to the end when they're accessed. But the problem says \"classic LRU\", so maybe they want the actual implementation without relying on OrderedDict. Because sometimes in interviews, they ask you to implement it from scratch.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For the get method: if the key exists, return the value and mark it as recently used (move it to the front). If not, return -1.\n\n2. For the put method: if the key exists, update the value and mark as recently used. If it doesn't, add the new key-value pair. If the cache is at capacity, remove the least recently used item (the tail of the linked list) before adding the new one.\n\nSo the data structures needed are:\n\n- A dictionary (hash map) to map keys to nodes in the linked list.\n- A doubly linked list where each node has key, value, prev, and next pointers.\n\nLet me outline the classes needed.\n\nFirst, a Node class for the doubly linked list. Each node has key, value, prev, next.\n\nThen, the LRUCache2 class which has:\n\n- capacity: int\n- cache: dict to store key -> Node\n- head and tail pointers for the doubly linked list. Maybe we can have dummy head and tail to simplify edge cases.\n\nWait, using dummy head and tail nodes can make the insertion and deletion easier because we don't have to check for null pointers as much.\n\nSo, when initializing LRUCache2, we set up the head and tail as dummy nodes, linked to each other.\n\nFor example:\n\nhead <-> tail\n\nWhen we add a new node, we add it right after head.\n\nWhen we need to evict, we remove the node before tail.\n\nSo, the steps for get:\n\n- Check if key is in cache.\n- If yes, remove the node from its current position, add it right after head (mark as most recently used), then return the value.\n- If not, return -1.\n\nFor put:\n\n- If key exists, update the value, then move the node to front (same as get).\n- Else, create a new node. If the cache is full (len(cache) == capacity), remove the least recently used (the node before tail), then add the new node to front.\n- Add the new node to the cache.\n\nWait, but when the cache is at capacity, we have to check before adding a new item. So in put, when adding a new key (not present), first check if the size is equal to capacity. If yes, evict the tail's prev node.\n\nNow, the methods to manage the linked list:\n\n- _remove_node(node): removes the node from the linked list.\n- _add_to_head(node): adds the node right after the head.\n\nWait, in some implementations, the head is the most recently used, and tail is least. So adding to head makes it MRU.\n\nWait, let's clarify the linked list structure.\n\nLet's say the head is a dummy node, and the actual MRU is head.next. The tail is a dummy node, and the actual LRU is tail.prev.\n\nSo when you get a key, you move that node to between head and head.next.\n\nSo, the order is: head -> MRU -> ... -> LRU -> tail.\n\nSo, when adding a new node, it's placed right after head.\n\nWhen evicting, we remove tail.prev.\n\nSo, the helper functions:\n\n_remove_node(node):\n\nprev_node = node.prev\n\nnext_node = node.next\n\nprev_node.next = next_node\n\nnext_node.prev = prev_node\n\n_add_node(node):\n\n# Insert right after head\n\nfirst_node = head.next\n\nhead.next = node\n\nnode.prev = head\n\nnode.next = first_node\n\nfirst_node.prev = node\n\nWait, yes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef _remove_node(self, node):\n\nprev = node.prev\n\nnxt = node.next\n\nprev.next = nxt\n\nnxt.prev = prev\n\ndef _a", "length_tokens": 2298}

The minimal period p is the smallest integer such that the string s can be formed by repeating the prefix of length p. For example, if s is \"ababab\", the minimal period is 2 because \"ab\" repeats three times.\n\nFirst, let's think about what conditions must be met for a period p to be valid. The length of the string, n, should be divisible by p. So n % p must be 0. Then, for each i from 0 to n-1, the character at position i should be equal to the character at position i mod p.\n\nSo the approach would be: iterate p from 1 to n (but maybe up to n//2 since the period can't be longer than n, but the minimal might be less). Wait, the maximum possible period is n itself (if the string has no repetition), but the problem says \"smallest p such that s is repeats of prefix length p\". So for a string like \"abc\", the minimal period is 3 because it can't be broken down into smaller repeating parts.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"smallest p such that s is repeats of prefix length p\". So for \"abc\", the only possible p is 3, since \"abc\" repeated once is \"abc\".\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each possible p starting from 1 up to len(s), check if len(s) is divisible by p. Because if not, then the string can't be formed by repeating a block of size p.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string length must be a multiple of p. For example, if s is \"abab\", length 4. Possible p could be 2 (since 4/2=2). If p=1, check if all characters are same. For \"abab\", p=1 would not work.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nFor p in 1 to n:\n\n   if n % p != 0: continue\n\n   Check if s is equal to s[0:p] repeated (n/p) times.\n\n   If yes, then p is a valid period. We need the smallest such p.\n\nSo the minimal p is the smallest one where this condition holds.\n\nSo for the function minimal_period(s), we can iterate p from 1 to n, check divisibility, then check if the string is composed of the prefix repeated.\n\nBut how to check efficiently?\n\nFor example, for each p where n % p == 0, check if for all i in 0..n-1, s[i] == s[i % p].\n\nSo the code could be:\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor p in range(1, n+1):\n\n    if n % p != 0:\n\n        continue\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if s[i] != s[i % p]:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if valid:\n\n        return p\n\nBut this might not be efficient for very long strings, but since the problem says \"minimal correct solution\", perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. For example, the minimal period is the smallest p such that s is a repetition of s[:p]. So another way is to check for all possible p that divides n (since n must be a multiple of p), and find the smallest p where s == s[:p] * (n//p).\n\nBut how to generate the possible p's?\n\nAlternatively, for p in 1 to n:\n\n   if n % p == 0:\n\n      if s == s[:p] * (n//p):\n\n          return p\n\nBut generating all p's from 1 to n and checking this condition would work.\n\nWait, but for example, if s is \"aaa\", n=3. Possible p=1: 3%1=0, s[:1] is 'a', repeated 3 times is 'aaa' which equals s. So return 1.\n\nAnother example: s = \"ababab\", n=6. p=2: 6%2=0, s[:2] is 'ab', repeated 3 times is 'ababab' which matches. So return 2.\n\nBut what about p=3? 6%3=0. s[:3] is 'aba', repeated 2 times is 'abaaba', which is not equal to 'ababab', so p=3 is invalid.\n\nSo the code would check p=1,2,3, etc., and return the first valid p.\n\nWait, but p=1: check if all characters are same. For \"ababab\", p=1 would fail because s[0] is 'a', s[1] is 'b' != 'a'.\n\nSo the code would check p=1, which fails, then p=2, which works.\n\nSo the code as described would work.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way. For example, instead of checking all p from 1 to n, we can check the divisors of n in increasing order. Because the minimal p must be a divisor of n. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, suppose n is 6. The possible p's that could work must divide 6.

Another example: \"abcabc\" has period 3. If the string is \"aaa\", the period is 1.

For a given p, the length of the string s must be a multiple of p. So len(s) % p should be 0. If not, p can't be a period.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to len(s)-1, s[i] should equal s[i % p].

Therefore, the possible p's to check are the divisors of len(s), ordered from smallest to largest.\n\nBut wait, is that true? Suppose s is \"abcabcab\". len(s) = 8. Let's see. If p=3, then 8 is not divisible by 3. So the string can't be exactly formed by repeating the prefix of length 3.

For each element a in A and b in B, compute a + b and increment the count in the dictionary.\n\nThen do the same for C and D: compute all sums c + d and store their counts in another dictionary.\n\nWait, but maybe even better: after getting the first dictionary (for A+B), then for each sum in C+D, check if the negative of that sum is in the first dictionary. But perhaps it's more efficient to process the second part on the fly.\n\nWait, the standard approach for 4Sum II problem (which this is) is to split into two pairs. Let me recall. Yes, the problem is similar to LeetCode 454. The solution is O(n^2) time.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute all possible sums of A[i] + B[j], store in a dictionary (sum_ab) where keys are the sums and values are the counts.\n\n2. For each sum in C[k] + D[l], check if -(that sum) exists in sum_ab. If yes, add the count from sum_ab to the total.\n\nWait, but actually, for each sum_cd = c + d, the required sum_ab is -sum_cd. So total += sum_ab.get(-sum_cd, 0).\n\nSo the total steps would be O(n^2) for building the first dictionary, and O(n^2) for processing the second part, which is acceptable.\n\nLet me verify with an example.\n\nSuppose A = [1,2], B = [-2,-1], C = [-1,2], D = [0,2].\n\nA+B sums: 1 + (-2) = -1; 1 + (-1) = 0; 2 + (-2) = 0; 2 + (-1) =1. So sum_ab would be {-1:1, 0:2, 1:1}.\n\nC+D sums: -1+0 = -1; -1+2=1; 2+0=2; 2+2=4. So sum_cd are [-1,1,2,4].\n\nNow, for each sum_cd in sum_cd_list:\n\n- For -1: need 1 in sum_ab. sum_ab has 1: count 1. So add 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, sum_ab + sum_cd =0 => sum_ab = -sum_cd.\n\nSo for sum_cd = -1, need sum_ab = 1. sum_ab has 1: count 1. So add 1.\n\nsum_cd =1: need sum_ab = -1. sum_ab has -1: count 1. Add 1.\n\nsum_cd=2: need sum_ab=-2. sum_ab doesn't have -2, so 0.\n\nsum_cd=4: need sum_ab=-4, which isn't present. So total is 1+1=2.\n\nSo the answer would be 2.\n\nLet me check the actual tuples.\n\nPossible combinations where sum is zero.\n\nLooking for A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] =0.\n\nLet's list all possibilities.\n\nA[0] =1, B[0] =-2: sum_ab = -1. Then C[k] + D[l] must be 1. Which C+D sums to 1? C[0]=-1, D[1]=2: -1+2=1. So that's one tuple: (0,0,0,1).\n\nAnother: A[1]=2, B[0]=-2: sum_ab=0. Need sum_cd=0. But C+D sums to 0? Let's see. C[0]=-1 and D[0]=0: sum is -1. C[1]=2 and D[0]=0: 2. No. So sum_cd=0 isn't present. So no tuples here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait sum_ab for A[1] + B[1] = 2 + (-1) =1. sum_cd needs to be -1. sum_cd=-1 is C[0] + D[0] = -1 +0 =-1. So tuple (1,1,0,0). So that's another one.\n\nSo total tuples: (0,0,0,1) and (1,1,0,0), which is 2. So the code works.\n\nYes, the approach is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Create a dictionary for A+B sums.\n\n- Iterate over C and D, compute sum_cd = c + d, check if -sum_cd is in the dictionary, add the count.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, for the first part, loop through A and B:\n\nsum_ab = {}\nfor a in A:\n    for b in B:\n        s = a + b\n        sum_ab[s] = sum_ab.get(s, 0) + 1\n\nThen, for the second part:\n\ncount = 0\nfor c in C:\n    for d in D:\n        s = c + d\n        count += sum_ab.get(-s, 0)\n\nReturn count.\n\nYes, that shou", "length_tokens": 1277}

The task is to count the number of tuples (i, j, k, l) such that A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] equals zero. Hmm, let's think about the possible approaches.\n\nFirst, the brute force method would be to check all possible combinations of i, j, k, l. But that's O(n^4) time, which is way too slow for large lists. So I need a smarter way.\n\nI remember that for two-sum problems, using a hash map to store sums and their counts can help. Maybe I can extend that idea here. Let's see.\n\nWhat if I split the four lists into two pairs. Like, compute all possible sums of A[i] + B[j] and store their frequencies in a dictionary. Then, for each sum of C[k] + D[l], check if the negative of that sum exists in the first dictionary. Because if (a + b) + (c + d) = 0, then (c + d) = -(a + b).\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute all possible sums from A and B, count how many times each sum occurs. Let's call this dict1.\n2. Compute all possible sums from C and D. For each sum s, check if -s is in dict1. If yes, add dict1[-s] to the total count.\n\nThis way, the time complexity would be O(n^2) for each part, so overall O(n^2), which is acceptable for n up to a few hundred. Since the problem doesn't specify constraints, but assuming n is manageable, this should work.\n\nLet me test this logic with an example.\n\nSuppose A = [1, -1], B = [0], C = [0], D = [1, -1].\n\nWait, but maybe a simpler example. Let's take A = [1, 2], B = [-2, -1], C = [-1, 0], D = [0, 1].\n\nCompute dict1 for A+B:\n\n1 + (-2) = -1\n\n1 + (-1) = 0\n\n2 + (-2) = 0\n\n2 + (-1) = 1\n\nSo dict1 would have: {-1:1, 0:2, 1:1}\n\nThen for C+D:\n\n-1 + 0 = -1\n\n-1 + 1 = 0\n\n0 + 0 = 0\n\n0 + 1 = 1\n\nSo sums are -1, 0, 0, 1.\n\nFor each of these sums s, check if -s is in dict1.\n\nFor s=-1: -s = 1, which is in dict1 (count 1). So add 1.\n\nFor s=0: -s=0, dict1 has 2. Add 2.\n\nAnother s=0: same, add 2.\n\nFor s=1: -s=-1, which is in dict1 (count 1). Add 1.\n\nTotal count: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6.\n\nLet me check all possible tuples:\n\nLooking for A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] =0.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\nFor A[i] + B[j] = -1 (from 1 + (-2)), then C[k] + D[l] must be 1. Which occurs when (C=-1, D=2?) Wait, in the example C is [-1, 0], D is [0,1]. So C[k] + D[l] = (-1 + 1)=0? Wait maybe my example is not correct. Let me recast.\n\nWait in the example, when C and D sums are -1, 0, 0, 1.\n\nWait for s=-1 (C+D sum), we need A+B sum to be 1. So when C+D is -1, then A+B must be 1. How many times does A+B sum to 1? Once (2 + (-1) =1). So for each occurrence of C+D=-1, add 1. There's one such occurrence (from -1 + 0), so 1.\n\nFor C+D=0, which occurs twice (from -1+1 and 0+0), we need A+B sum to be 0. Which occurs twice (1 + (-1) and 2 + (-2)). So 2 * 2 =4.\n\nFor C+D=1 (0 +1), need A+B sum to be -1, which occurs once. So 1.\n\nTotal 1 +4 +1 =6. Which matches the previous count. So the logic works.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, create a dictionary for the sum of A and B.\n\nLoop through each element in A and B, compute the sum, and count occurrences.\n\nThen, loop through each element in C and D, compute sum, check if -sum is in the dict, and add the count.\n\nLet's code that.\n\nInitialize a defaultdict(int) for the first part.\n\nfor a in A:\n    for b in B:\n        sum_ab = a + b\n        dict1[sum_ab] +=1\n\nThen, total =0\n\nfor c in C:\n    for d in D:\n        sum_cd = c + d\n        target = -sum_cd\n        if target in dict1:\n            total += dict1[target]\n\nReturn total.\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nLet me check edge cases.\n\nCase where all elements are zero. A=B=C=D = [0,0].\n\nThen sum_ab can be 0+0=0, so dict1[0] = 4 (since 2x2=4 combinations).\n\nsum_cd for C and D: same, 4 combinations, each sum is 0.\n\nFor each sum_cd=0, target is 0. So total +=4 *4=16.\n\nWhich is correct, because all 2^4=16 tuples sum to zero.\n\nAnother edge case: empty lists. But the problem probably assumes non-empty, but the code would return 0.\n\nAnother case: no possible tuples. Like A=[1], B=[1], C=[1], D=[1]. Sum is 4, so no tuples.

Let's think: For each element in A and B, sum them up and store the frequency of each sum. Then, for each sum in C and D, check if the negative of that sum exists in the first hash map.

But each list can have up to n elements, so that's O(n^4) time, which is way too slow for large n. Like, if n is 100, 100^4 is 100,000,000, which might be manageable, but if n is 500, it's 62.5 billion operations. So that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, maybe I can split the problem into two parts. Like, compute all possible sums from A and B, then all possible sums from C and D, and then see how many pairs add up to zero.\n\nWait, right. For example, if I first calculate all possible sums from A and B, store them in a hash map (or dictionary) where the key is the sum and the value is the number of times that sum occurs. Then, for each sum in C and D, I can check if the negative of that sum exists in the AB sums. Because if AB_sum + CD_sum = 0, then CD_sum = -AB_sum.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute all possible sums of elements from A and B. For each a in A and b in B, sum = a + b. Store the count of each sum in a dictionary.\n\n2. Similarly, compute all possible sums from C and D. But instead of storing them, for each sum in C and D (let's call it cd_sum), check if -cd_sum exists in the AB dictionary. If it does, add the count from AB to the total.\n\nWait, but maybe it's more efficient to compute the AB sums first, then iterate through CD sums and check.\n\nLet me think. Suppose AB_sums is a dictionary where key is sum_ab, value is count. Then for each c in C and d in D, sum_cd = c + d. We need sum_ab + sum_cd = 0 => sum_ab = -sum_cd. So for each sum_cd, the number of valid AB pairs is AB_sums.get(-sum_cd, 0). So total += AB_sums.get(-sum_cd, 0).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the time complexity would be O(n^2) for building the AB dictionary, and O(n^2) for processing CD, so overall O(n^2), which is much better.\n\nLet's check with an example. Suppose A = [1, -1], B = [-1, 1], C = [0, 0], D = [0, 0].\n\nAB sums: 1 + (-1) = 0, 1+1=2, -1 + (-1) = -2, -1 +1=0. So the AB dictionary would have {0: 2, 2:1, -2:1}.\n\nCD sums: 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0. So sum_cd is 0 for all. Then for each 0, we look for -0=0 in AB. The count is 2. There are 4 CD pairs, so total is 4 * 2 = 8. Let's see: the tuples would be (0,0,0,0), (0,0,0,1), (0,0,1,0), (0,0,1,1), (1,1,0,0), etc. Wait, but AB has two 0s (from (0,1) and (1,0) maybe?), so each of the 4 CD pairs can pair with 2 AB pairs, so 8 total. That seems correct.\n\nAnother example: A = [0], B = [0], C = [0], D = [0]. Then AB sum is 0, CD sum is 0. So total is 1 (AB count) * 1 (CD count) = 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems valid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, create a dictionary for AB sums. For each a in A and b in B, compute a + b and increment the count in the dictionary.\n\nThen, for each c in C and d in D, compute c + d, and check if -(c + d) is in the AB dictionary. If yes, add the count to the total.\n\nWait, but in code, it's sum_cd = c + d, and we want sum_ab = -sum_cd. So for each sum_cd, total += ab_dict.get(-sum_cd, 0).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef four_sum_count_zero(A, B, C, D):\n    ab_sums = {}\n    for a in A:\n        for b in B:\n            total_ab = a + b\n            ab_sums[total_ab] = ab_sums.get(total_ab, 0) + 1\n    count = 0\n    for c in C:\n        for d in D:\n            total_cd = c + d\n            count += ab_sums.get(-total_cd, 0)\n    return count\n\nWait, but what if the sum is not present? The get method returns 0, so that's handled.\n\nLet me test with the first example. A = [1, -1], B = [-1, 1], so ab_sums:\n\n1 + (-1) = 0 → count 1\n\n1 + 1 = 2 → count 1\n\n-1 + (-1) = -2 → count 1\n\n-1 + 1 = 0 → count 2\n\nSo ab_sums is {0:2, 2:1, -2:1}\n\nC and D are [0,0] each. So CD sums are 0+0=0 (four times). For each, -0 is 0, which is in ab_sums with count 2. So 4 * 2 = 8. The code returns 8, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: A = [0], B = [0], C = [0], D = [0]. ab_sums has {0:1}. CD sum is 0. count += 1. So returns 1. Correct.\n\nWhat ", "length_tokens": 974}

Let's see. The function signature is given: simulated_annealing_optimize(f, x0, T0, cooling, iters, seed=0) -> float. The goal is to return the best x found.\n\nFirst, recall how simulated annealing works. It's a probabilistic technique for finding the global minimum of a function. It starts with an initial solution and temperature T0. At each iteration, it perturbs the current solution (using a Gaussian step here), calculates the change in energy (which is f(x)), and decides whether to accept the new solution based on the Metropolis criterion.\n\nSo, steps for 1D:\n\n1. Initialize x_current = x0, best_x = x0, best_f = f(x0).\n2. Set initial temperature T = T0.\n3. For each iteration up to 'iters':\n   a. Generate a new candidate x_new by adding a Gaussian step (mean 0, standard deviation maybe 1? Or should it be scaled by temperature? Hmm, in some implementations the step size is related to temperature. Wait, the problem says \"Gaussian steps\", so probably the step is N(0, 1) scaled by something. Wait, maybe the standard deviation is proportional to T. Or maybe the step is generated as x_current + T * random.gauss(0, 1). Because as temperature decreases, the steps get smaller. That makes sense. Let me check typical SA implementations.\n\nYes, in many cases, the step size is proportional to the current temperature. So the perturbation is T * random.gauss(0, 1). So for 1D, the new x is x_current + T * step, where step is a standard normal variable.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Gaussian steps\", so perhaps the step is drawn from a Gaussian distribution. The standard deviation might be fixed or depend on T. The problem statement isn't specific, but in standard SA, the step size often decreases with temperature. So using T as the standard deviation makes sense here. So the step is N(0, T), which would mean generating a random number with mean 0 and standard deviation T.\n\nWait, but in code, random.gauss(mu, sigma) takes mu and sigma. So if we do x_new = x_current + random.gauss(0, T), then the step has standard deviation T.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the step is scaled by a factor, but given the problem statement, I think using T as the sigma is the right approach here.\n\nSo for each iteration:\n\n- Generate x_new = x_current + random.gauss(0, T)\n- Compute delta = f(x_new) - f(x_current)\n- If delta < 0 (better solution), accept x_new.\n- Else, accept with probability exp(-delta / T)\n- If accepted, update x_current to x_new\n- Track the best x (the one with the lowest f value encountered)\n\nThen, after each iteration, cool the temperature: T = T * cooling. Cooling is a factor, like 0.95, so each step T is multiplied by cooling.\n\nWait, cooling parameter here is probably the factor by which T is multiplied each iteration. So T_new = T * cooling.\n\nWait, the parameter is called 'cooling', which is a float. So for example, if cooling is 0.9, then each iteration T is multiplied by 0.9.\n\nYes, that's standard.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nInitialize x_best = x0, f_best = f(x0)\n\nSet current x = x0\n\nSet T = T0\n\nFor each iteration in range(iters):\n\n   Generate x_new = x + random.gauss(0, T)\n\n   Compute f_new = f(x_new)\n\n   delta = f_new - f(x)\n\n   If delta < 0 or random.random() < exp(-delta / T):\n\n       x = x_new\n\n       if f_new < f_best:\n\n           f_best = f_new\n\n           x_best = x_new\n\n   T = T * cooling\n\nWait, but cooling is applied every iteration, regardless of acceptance.\n\nWait, in the loop, after possibly accepting the new x, we cool the temperature.\n\nWait, the cooling schedule is applied each iteration, so T is updated after each step.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, need to handle the seed. The problem says seed is an optional parameter, default 0. So we should set the random seed at the beginning.\n\nWait, the user specifies seed=0 as default. So in the function, we should set random.seed(seed) at the start.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"seed:int=0\", so the function has a seed parameter. So inside the function, we need to initialize the random number generator with that seed.\n\nSo first line after ", "score": 0.3333333333333333, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.10666666666666667, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 1703, "metadata": {"tests": ["import math; x=simulated_annealing_optimize(lambda x: -(x-3)**2, 0.0, 1.0, 0.99, 1000,seed=1); assert abs(x-3.0)<0.5"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}, "exec_traces": [{"test_index": 0, "returncode": 1, "stdout": "", "stderr": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/tmpjbtb1704.py\", line 29, in <module>\n    import math; x=simulated_annealing_optimize(lambda x: -(x-3)**2, 0.0, 1.0, 0.99, 1000,seed=1); assert abs(x-3.0)<0.5\n                                                                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAssertionError\n"}]}

I need to implement the simulated annealing optimization for a 1D function. The problem says it's in one dimension with Gaussian steps. So, the function f is a function of a single variable x.\n\nFirst, I should recall how simulated annealing works. Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. It starts with an initial solution and iteratively moves to neighboring solutions. The key idea is that it allows for some probability of accepting worse solutions to escape local minima, especially early on when the temperature is high.\n\nThe parameters given are:\n- f: the objective function to minimize (I assume it's minimization since it's common in optimization)\n- x0: initial guess\n- T0: initial temperature\n- cooling: cooling rate, which probably reduces the temperature each iteration\n- iters: number of iterations\n- seed: random seed for reproducibility\n\nThe task is to return the best x found during the process.\n\nSo, steps for the algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize x_current = x0, x_best = x0, f_best = f(x0)\n2. Set current temperature T = T0\n3. For each iteration from 1 to iters:\n   a. Generate a neighbor x_new by taking a Gaussian step from x_current. Since it's 1D, the step can be x_current + step_size * random.gauss(0, 1). Wait, but the problem says \"Gaussian steps\". So the step size might be related to the temperature? Or maybe the standard deviation is proportional to T? Hmm, but the problem statement doesn't specify. Wait, in standard simulated annealing, the step size can be adjusted based on temperature, but perhaps here they just use a Gaussian step with some fixed variance, but maybe scaled by T.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Gaussian steps\". So perhaps the new position is generated as x_new = x_current + random.gauss(0, T), since temperature often controls the step size. But the exact step generation isn't specified. Alternatively, maybe the step is scaled by T. Let me think. In some implementations, the step size decreases as temperature decreases, but maybe here the step is drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation proportional to T. Let me check common practices.\n\nIn simulated annealing, the neighborhood function can vary. For continuous variables, a common approach is to use a normal distribution with standard deviation proportional to the current temperature. So perhaps the step is x_new = x_current + T * random.gauss(0, 1). That way, as T cools down, the steps become smaller.\n\nSo the step would be generated using a Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation equal to T. Wait, but maybe the problem expects a different scaling. The problem statement just says \"Gaussian steps\", so maybe the standard deviation is 1, but that doesn't make sense because as temperature decreases, you want smaller steps. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the step size is fixed, but the acceptance probability depends on T. Wait, no, the step generation is part of the algorithm. Let me think again. In the standard simulated annealing for continuous functions, the neighborhood is often defined as a random perturbation, which can be Gaussian with a variance that may or may not depend on temperature.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"with Gaussian steps\", so perhaps the step is generated as a Gaussian random variable. The exact parameters (mean and variance) are not specified, but in many SA implementations, the step size is scaled by the current temperature. So for example, the new x is x_current + delta, where delta ~ N(0, T). So the standard deviation is T. That way, as T decreases, the steps become smaller.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the step is scaled by T multiplied by some constant, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that the standard deviation is proportional to T.

Since it's a 1D problem, each step involves generating a new candidate x by adding a Gaussian random step to the current x. The standard deviation of the Gaussian might be related to the current temperature, but the problem statement says \"Gaussian steps\". Wait, the problem says \"SA in 1D with Gaussian steps\". So the step size is determined by a Gaussian distribution. Maybe the standard deviation is proportional to the current temperature? Or perhaps the step size is fixed, but the acceptance depends on temperature.\n\nWait, in standard simulated annealing, the step size might be adjusted, but here it's specified as Gaussian steps. Let me think. The problem says \"Gaussian steps\", so each new candidate is generated by x_new = x_current + random.gauss(0, step_size). But what's the step_size here? Maybe the standard deviation is proportional to the current temperature. However, the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps the step size is fixed? Wait, but in simulated annealing, the temperature controls the acceptance probability, but the step size might be fixed or adjusted. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Gaussian steps\", so maybe each step is a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation related to the current temperature. For example, perhaps the standard deviation is T, the current temperature. Because as temperature decreases, the steps become smaller. That makes sense.\n\nSo, in each iteration:\n\n1. Current temperature T = T0 * (cooling)^iteration. Wait, cooling rate: if cooling is a factor like 0.99, then each iteration T *= cooling.\n\nWait, the cooling parameter is a float. So maybe T starts at T0, and each iteration T = T * cooling. So after iters steps, T = T0 * cooling^iters.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Initialize x_best = x0, f_best = f(x0)\n- Current x = x0\n- For each iteration in range(iters):\n   - Current temperature T = T0 * (cooling)^iteration\n   - Generate a new x_new = x + random.gauss(0, T)  [since Gaussian step with std T]\n   - Compute delta = f(x_new) - f(x)\n   - If delta < 0 (better solution), accept x_new\n   - Else, accept with probability exp(-delta / T)\n   - If accepted, update x to x_new\n   - If f(x_new) is better than f_best, update x_best and f_best\n- Return x_best\n\nWait, but the step size: is the standard deviation of the Gaussian step equal to T? That's a common approach. Because as T decreases, the steps get smaller, allowing for finer exploration.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So in each iteration, the proposal is x_new = x + N(0, T).\n\nWait, but in some implementations, the step size is fixed, and the temperature only affects the acceptance probability.

It's inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. So, the idea is to start with a high temperature and gradually cool it down, allowing the algorithm to escape local minima by sometimes accepting worse solutions.\n\nIn 1D, the state is just a single float x. The algorithm starts at x0. For each iteration, we generate a new candidate by perturbing the current x. The problem mentions Gaussian steps, so the perturbation should be a random number from a normal distribution. Wait, but in 1D, a Gaussian step would be adding a random value with mean 0 and some standard deviation. But the problem doesn't specify the standard deviation. Hmm. Maybe it's fixed, like step size? Or perhaps the standard deviation is related to the temperature? Wait, in some implementations, the step size might be proportional to the temperature.

For example, the standard deviation of the Gaussian could be proportional to the current temperature. Let me think. Let's check the problem statement again: \"SA in 1D with Gaussian steps\". So the step is generated by a Gaussian distribution. But the exact parameters (mean and variance) aren't specified. Maybe the standard deviation is fixed, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the step is generated as x_new = x + random.gauss(0, 1) * something. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention a step size parameter. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps in this problem, the Gaussian step has a standard deviation of 1, but scaled by the current temperature. Or maybe the step size is fixed, but the acceptance probability depends on temperature. Let me recall the standard SA steps.\n\nThe general steps are:\n\n1. Initialize x to x0, T to T0.\n2. For each iteration:\n   a. Generate a new candidate x_new by perturbing x (using Gaussian steps here).\n   b. Compute delta = f(x_new) - f(x).\n   c.

Track the best solution found so far.\n\nWait, but the cooling schedule here is probably multiplicative: T_{k+1} = cooling * T_k. So cooling is a factor less than 1, like 0.95.\n\nNow, the Gaussian step: in 1D, the perturbation is a random number from a normal distribution. But what's the variance? The problem says \"Gaussian steps\", but doesn't specify parameters. Maybe the standard deviation is 1.0, but perhaps it's scaled by the current temperature.

For each subset, we track the number of ways to arrange the nodes in that subset such that the ordering is a valid topological sort up to that point.\n\nThe key idea is that a valid topological sort for a subset S must end with a node that has all its predecessors (in the entire graph) already included in S (except possibly itself). Wait, no: when building the ordering, each node added must have all its in-neighbors (parents) already in the subset before adding it. So for a given subset S, the nodes that can be added next are those in S whose in-degree within the subgraph induced by S is zero. Wait, no: the in-degree in the entire graph, but only considering the nodes not yet added.

The nodes in S are the ones already placed in the ordering. To add a new node v not in S, v must have no incoming edges from nodes not in S.

So for v to be a valid next node, all in-neighbors of v must be in S.\n\nSo the recurrence is: dp[S] = sum over all v not in S where all predecessors of v are in S of dp[S ∪ {v}].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the DP state is usually the number of ways to arrange the nodes in S into a valid topological order. So when building up S, for each S, dp[S] is the count. To compute dp[S], we look at all possible last elements v in S, such that when we remove v from S, the remaining subset S' = S \\ {v} has a valid topological order, and v has no incoming edges from outside S' (i.e., all predecessors of v are in S').\n\nWait, more accurately, for S to have a valid topological order ending with v, all predecessors of v must be in S' (since S' is S without v).

For each node v in mask, if all of v's predecessors (in the original graph) are also in mask (but wait, no: predecessors must be in mask except v itself?), no. Wait, when adding v as the last node in the ordering for mask, all predecessors of v must have been added before v.

So when we have the current set S (nodes already placed), to add v next, all predecessors of v must be in S. Because if any predecessor is not in S, then it's after v in the order, which is invalid.\n\nSo for each subset S, the valid nodes to add next are those nodes v not in S such that all predecessors of v are in S.\n\nTherefore, the DP state is dp[mask], which represents the number of topological orderings for the subset of nodes represented by mask.\n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty set has one ordering).\n\nFor each mask, we look at all nodes v not in mask.

The approach should use dynamic programming over subsets. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, topological sort counts for a DAG. For small n (like up to 20), DP over subsets is feasible because 2^20 is about a million, which is manageable.\n\nThe standard approach for counting topological sorts with DP on subsets is as follows:\n\n- Let dp[mask] be the number of ways to arrange the nodes in the subset represented by mask such that all dependencies are satisfied (i.e., it's a valid prefix of a topological sort).\n\n- The base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty subset has one way).\n\n- To compute dp[mask], we consider all nodes j that are in mask and have all their incoming edges (dependencies) already included in mask (i.e., all parents of j are in mask). For each such node j, we can add it as the last element in the permutation for mask, so dp[mask] += dp[mask without j].\n\nWait, but how do we check which nodes can be added next? For each node j, the predecessors (in-neighbors) must all be in the current mask when we add j. Wait, no: when building the permutation, each node must come after all its predecessors. So when considering adding a node j to a subset mask, all predecessors of j must already be in mask. Wait, no: the mask represents the nodes already placed in the permutation. So for j to be the next node, all predecessors of j must be in the mask (i.e., already placed before j). Therefore, for a given mask, the valid nodes to add next are those j not in mask, such that all predecessors of j are in mask.\n\nWait, right. So for each mask, the nodes that can be added are those j where (predecessors[j] is a subset of mask) and j is not in mask.\n\nSo the recurrence is: for each mask, dp[mask] = sum over all j not in mask where predecessors[j] ⊆ mask of dp[mask without j].\n\nWait, no. Wait, the dp[mask] represents the number of orderings for the subset mask. So to build dp[mask], we look at all possible last elements j in the ordering. For j to be the last element, all its predecessors must be in mask (but since j is in mask, and the predecessors must be before j, so all predecessors of j must be in mask \\ {j}).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think: for each mask, dp[mask] is the number of topological orderings of the nodes in mask. To compute this, we consider all possible nodes j in mask that have no incoming edges from outside mask (i.e., all predecessors of j are in mask). Wait, no: j can have predecessors, but they must all be in mask. Because in the ordering for mask, all predecessors of j must come before j, so they have to be part of mask.\n\nWait, the standard recurrence is: dp[mask] = sum_{j in mask, and in_degree(mask, j) == 0} dp[mask without j]\n\nBut how to compute in_degree(mask, j)? For each j, the number of predecessors that are in mask. Wait, but for j to be a valid node to place next (as the last element in the ordering for mask), all predecessors of j must be in mask. Wait, no: if j is in mask, then all its predecessors must be in mask (since the graph is a DAG, and the topological sort includes all nodes in mask, so any predecessor of j must be in mask if j is included). Wait, no. Suppose mask includes j but not some predecessor of j. Then the topological sort for mask would be invalid, because j comes before its predecessor, which is not in mask. Wait, but mask is a subset of nodes. Wait, no: the topological sort is for the entire graph, but here we are counting the number of linear extensions for subsets. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the graph may have edges that go outside the subset. Hmm, no. Wait, the DP over subsets approach for counting topological sorts assumes that the subset mask is closed under predecessors. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, let's clarify.

So the function should return 4 for this input.\n\nNow, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nI remember that this is a classic dynamic programming problem, or can be solved using a stack.\n\nLet me think of possible approaches.\n\nApproach 1: Using a stack. The idea is to track indices of opening parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, pop from the stack. If the stack becomes empty, push the current index as a new starting point. Otherwise, compute the current valid length as current index minus the top of the stack.\n\nWait, the standard approach for this problem uses a stack where we push -1 as the initial index. Then, for each character:\n\n- If it's '(', push the index.\n\n- If it's ')', pop from the stack.\n\n   - If stack is empty after pop, push current index (as a new starting point for the next valid substring).\n\n   - Else, current length is current index - stack's top.\n\nWe keep track of the maximum length.\n\nLet me test this approach with the example.\n\nExample: s = ')()())', indices 0-5.\n\nInitialize stack with -1.\n\ncurrent max_len = 0.\n\ni=0: character ')'\n\nstack is [-1], pop gives -1. Now stack is empty. Push 0. Stack is [0].\n\nmax_len remains 0.\n\ni=1: '('\n\npush 1. Stack [0,1]\n\ni=2: ')'\n\npop from stack. Now stack is [0]. Current index 2. Length is 2 - 0 = 2. max_len becomes 2.\n\ni=3: '('\n\npush 3. Stack [0,3]\n\ni=4: ')'\n\npop. Stack becomes [0]. Length 4-0=4. max_len=4.\n\ni=5: ')'\n\npop from stack (stack is [0], pop gives 0. Now stack is empty. Push 5. Stack [5].\n\nSo max_len is 4. Which matches the expected result.\n\nAnother test case: s = '()(())'\n\nIndices 0-5:\n\n0: '(' → stack [ -1, 0 ]\n\n1: ')' → pop to -1, length 1 - (-1) = 2. max_len=2.\n\n2: '(' → stack [ -1, 2 ]\n\n3: '(' → stack [ -1, 2, 3 ]\n\n4: ')' → pop to 2, length 4-2=2. max_len=2.\n\n5: ')' → pop to -1, length 5 - (-1) =6. max_len=6.\n\nWait, but the string is '()(())' which is valid entire string, length 6. So yes.\n\nAnother example: s = '()'\n\nstack starts with -1.\n\ni=0: '(', stack [ -1, 0 ]\n\ni=1: ')', pop to -1, length 1 - (-1) =2.

So the answer for the example should be 4.\n\nNow, how to compute this programmatically.\n\nI remember that dynamic programming is a common approach for this problem. Let's think about the DP approach.\n\nThe idea is to use a DP array where dp[i] represents the length of the longest valid substring ending at index i.\n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 0 since a single parenthesis can't be valid.\n\nFor each i from 1 to len(s)-1:\n\n- If s[i] is '(', then dp[i] = 0 because a closing bracket is needed.\n- If s[i] is ')':\n   - Check the previous character (i-1):\n      - If s[i-1] is '(', then dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 2 (if i >= 2, else 2)\n      - If s[i-1] is ')', then check if the character before the valid substring ending at i-1 is '('. So look at s[i - dp[i-1] - 1]. If that's '(', then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 + dp[i - dp[i-1] - 2]\n\nWait, maybe I need to formalize this.\n\nLet me think through the steps.\n\nFor example, in the string '()()':\n\nIndices 0: '(', 1: ')', 2: '(', 3: ')'\n\ndp[1] = 2 (for '()')\ndp[3] = dp[2-1 (which is 1) ] + 2? Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nAnother common method is to use a stack. The stack stores indices of '('.\n\nInitialize stack with -1 (as a base for calculating lengths).\n\nFor each index i in s:\n\n- If s[i] is '(', push i onto stack.\n- Else (it's ')'):\n   - Pop from stack.\n   - If stack is empty, push i (as a new base).\n   - Else, current length is i - stack[-1], update max_length.\n\nWait, let's try this with the example.\n\nExample: s = ')()())'\n\nIndices 0 to 5.\n\nInitialize stack = [-1], max_len = 0.\n\ni=0: s[0] = ')'\n   stack is [-1], pop → stack becomes empty.\n   Since stack is empty, push i=0 → stack = [0]\n\ni=1: s[1] = '(' → push → stack = [0,1]\n\ni=2: s[2] = ')'\n   pop → stack becomes [0]\n   stack not empty. current length = 2 - 0 = 2. max_len=2.\n\ni=3: '(', push → stack [0,3]\n\ni=4: ')'\n   pop → stack [0]\n   current length 4 - 0 =4. max_len=4.\n\ni=5: ')'\n   pop → stack was [0], after pop becomes empty.\n   so push i=5 → stack [5]\n   max_len remains 4.\n\nSo the result is 4, which matches the example.\n\nThis stack approach seems to work.\n\nLet me test another example to make sure.\n\nTake s = '()(())'\n\nIndices 0: '(', 1: ')', 2: '(', 3: '(', 4: ')', 5: ')'\n\nWait, no, '()(())' is 6 characters.\n\nLet's process:\n\nstack starts as [-1]\n\ni=0: '(', stack [-1,0]\n\ni=1: ')', pop to [-1], length 1 - (-1) = 2. max=2.\n\ni=2: '(', stack [-1,2]\n\ni=3: '(', stack [-1,2,3]\n\ni=4: ')', pop to [-1,2], length 4-2=2. max=2 (but previous max is 2, now 2 again.

When we see a ')', we pop. After popping, if the stack isn't empty, the current valid length is current index minus the top of the stack (which is the index after the last invalid position). If the stack is empty after popping, we push the current index as the new starting point.\n\nLet's apply this to the example ')()())'.\n\nIndices 0 to 5.\n\nInitialize stack = [-1], max_len = 0.\n\ni=0: character is ')'\nPop stack: now stack is empty. So we push 0. Stack becomes [0].\n\ni=1: '(' → push 1. Stack [0,1]\n\ni=2: ')' → pop → stack top is 0. Current length is 2-0=2. max_len=2.\n\ni=3: '(' → push 3. Stack [0,3]\n\ni=4: ')' → pop → stack top 0. Length 4-0=4. max_len=4.\n\ni=5: ')' → pop → stack now has [0], but after popping, stack is empty? Wait, stack before popping at i=5 is [0,3].

Since it's empty, push current index 0. Stack is [0].\n\ni=1: '(', push → stack [0,1]\n\ni=2: ')', pop → stack becomes [0]. Now, stack is not empty. current length is 2 - stack[-1] (0) = 2. max_len = 2.\n\ni=3: '(', push → [0,3]\n\ni=4: ')', pop → stack becomes [0]. current length 4 - 0 =4. max_len=4.\n\ni=5: ')', pop → stack becomes empty.

Let me recall how suffix automata work.\n\nFirst, I remember that a suffix automaton is a powerful data structure for string processing. One of its key properties is that it can efficiently count the number of distinct substrings in a string. The idea is that each state in the SAM represents a set of substrings that have the same end positions. The number of distinct substrings can be calculated by summing up the differences between the maximum and minimum lengths of the substrings represented by each state.\n\nWait, more precisely, for each state in the SAM (excluding the initial state), the number of distinct substrings contributed by that state is (state.length - state.link.length). Because the state's length is the maximum length of the substrings it represents, and the link's length is the maximum length of the substrings in the previous state (the suffix link). So the difference gives the number of new substrings added when this state was created.\n\nSo the total number of distinct substrings is the sum over all states (except the initial) of (len - link.len). Let me verify this.\n\nYes, for example, if a state has a max length of 5 and its suffix link's max length is 3, then this state contributes 5 - 3 = 2 new substrings. Because the substrings of length 4 and 5 are unique to this state.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Build the suffix automaton for the input string s.\n2. Traverse all states (except the initial state) and sum (state.length - state.link.length).\n\nNow, how to build the SAM?\n\nThe SAM is built incrementally. Each state has:\n- length: the length of the longest substring in the state.\n- link: the suffix link.\n- next: a dictionary of transitions (char -> state).\n\nThe initial state (state 0) has length 0 and link to -1 (or None).\n\nWe start with the initial state, and then process each character of the string one by one.\n\nThe standard algorithm for building the SAM involves maintaining a last state, which is the state after adding the previous character.\n\nWhen adding a new character c:\n- Create a new state cur with length = last.length + 1.\n- Traverse back from last via suffix links until we find a state p that has a transition on c, or reach the root.\n- If no such state p exists, set cur's link to the initial state (0).\n- Else, let q be the state p.next[c].\n  - If q.length == p.length + 1, then cur's link is q.\n  - Else, we need to clone q: create a new state clone, copy q's next and link, set clone.length = p.length + 1. Then update q's link and cur's link to clone. Also, backtrack from p via suffix links and fix transitions to q that should point to clone.\n\nAfter building the SAM, sum (state.length - state.link.length) for all states except the initial.\n\nWait, but the initial state (state 0) has link as -1 (or None), so we have to skip it. Also, when summing, for each state that has a valid link (i.e., not -1), we compute the difference.\n\nLet me think of a small example. Let's take s = \"ab\".\n\nBuilding the SAM:\n\nInitial state 0.\n\nAdd 'a':\n- cur is state 1, length 1.\n- p starts at last (0). Check if 0 has transition 'a'? No. So set link to 0? Wait, no.

The key properties are that the number of distinct substrings can be derived from the SAM structure.\n\nI remember that in a SAM, each state has a 'len' which is the length of the longest string in that state.

Wait, no, maybe it's the sum of (current state's len - its link's len) for all states. Because each state contributes the number of new substrings that end at that state.\n\nLet me think. For example, the initial state (state 0) has len 0. Then when we add characters, each new state contributes (current.len - link.len) new substrings. So the total distinct substrings would be the sum of (st.len - st.link.len) for all states except the start state? Or including?\n\nWait, the start state (state 0) has len 0, and its link is maybe itself? No, the link of the start state is usually -1 or null, but in some implementations, the start state's link is null. Wait, perhaps the initial state (state 0) is the root, and when you create new states, their links point to other states.\n\nWait, the standard way to compute the number of distinct substrings using SAM is to note that each state corresponds to a set of substrings that are suffixes of each other. The number of distinct substrings contributed by a state is (len(state) - len(link(state))). Because the link state's len is the length of the longest suffix of the current state's strings that is in another state. So the current state's strings range from (link.len + 1) to len, so the count is len - link.len.\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct substrings is the sum over all states (except the start state?) of (len - link.len). Wait, but the start state may have len 0, so if we include it, it would contribute 0. So maybe the sum over all states (including start) would be the same as sum over all states except start. Wait, let's see.\n\nFor example, take the string \"a\". The SAM would have states:\n\n- State 0: initial, len 0, link -1 (or null)\n- State 1: created when adding 'a', len 1, link to state 0.\n\nSo sum would be (1 - 0) = 1, which is correct (substrings: \"a\").\n\nAnother example: \"ab\". Let's see.\n\nAfter processing 'a', state 1 as before.\n\nProcessing 'b':\n\n- Current state is 1.

Wait, in the \"a\" example, sum is 1 (state 1: 1-0=1), which is correct.

In a SAM, each state has a 'len' attribute which is the length of the longest string in that state. When building the SAM, each new state (except the initial one) is created during the extension process. For each state, the number of distinct substrings that end at that state is len(state) - len(link(state)), where link is the suffix link.\n\nSo the total number of distinct substrings would be the sum over all states (except the initial one, maybe) of (len(state) - len(link(state))). Because each state contributes the number of new substrings that are added when that state is created.\n\nWait, let's think. The initial state (state 0) probably has len 0. Then, as we add each character, we create new states. For example, when building the SAM for \"ab\", the distinct substrings are \"a\", \"b\", \"ab\", so 3. Let's see how the formula works.\n\nBut maybe I should look up the standard approach. Oh right, the standard formula for the number of distinct substrings using SAM is the sum for all states (excluding the root) of (st[state].length - st[st[state].link].length). Because each state's contribution is the number of new substrings that are added when that state is created, which is the difference between its max length and its suffix link's max length.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1.

Let me recall how suffix automata work for counting distinct substrings.\n\nFirst, the suffix automaton (SAM) is a finite automaton that recognizes all suffixes of a string. One of the key properties is that the number of distinct substrings can be calculated by summing up the number of distinct paths starting from the initial state. Each state in the SAM represents some set of substrings, and the transitions between states represent extending those substrings.\n\nWait, another way I remember is that for each state (except the initial one), the number of distinct substrings ending at that state is (length of the state - length of its link's state). So the total distinct substrings would be the sum over all states (except the initial) of (len(state) - len(link(state))).\n\nLet me confirm that. The SAM construction has each state with a 'length' which is the length of the longest string in that state. The suffix link points to the state with the longest suffix of that string which is in another state. So for each state, the number of new distinct substrings contributed is (current state's length - the suffix link's length). Because the state represents all substrings from (link's length + 1) up to current length. So summing these differences across all states gives the total distinct substrings.\n\nYes, for example, if a state has length 5 and its suffix link's state has length 3, then this state contributes 5 - 3 = 2 new substrings. Wait, no: the state's longest string is length 5, and the suffix link points to the state with longest string length 3. So the substrings that end at this state are of lengths 4 and 5 (since 3+1 to 5). Wait, no, maybe it's the difference in lengths. So 5 - 3 = 2, which would mean two new substrings. But actually, the number of distinct substrings contributed by the state is (len - link.len). Because the state's substrings are all the suffixes of the longest string that are longer than the link's longest string. So for example, if the longest string in the state is 'abcd' (len 4), and the link's longest is 'bc' (len 2), then the substrings added are 'cd', 'bcd', 'abcd'? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the direction.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of distinct substrings is equal to the sum for each state of (state.length - state.link.length). Because each state represents a set of substrings that are suffixes of the longest one, and the number of new substrings added when this state was created is the difference between its length and the link's length.\n\nSo for the entire SAM, after building it, the total distinct substrings would be the sum of (st.length - st.link.length) for all states except the initial one (since the initial state's link is null, but maybe the initial state doesn't contribute anything).\n\nWait, the initial state (state 0) usually has length 0 and its link is None. So when we sum over all states except the initial, but maybe the initial state isn't counted. Let's think with a simple example.\n\nTake the string \"a\". The SAM would have:\n\n- State 0: initial, len 0, link to -1 (null)\n- State 1: len 1, link to 0.\n\nThe distinct substrings are \"a\", so count is 1. Sum is (1 - 0) = 1.

For each of these numbers, find the pair of divisors that are closest together. Then compare the two pairs (from n+1 and n+2) and choose the one with the smallest difference.\n\nWait, but how do I find the closest divisors for a number? Well, the closest divisors of a number m would be around the square root of m. Because if you have a number m, the pair of factors that are closest to each other will be around sqrt(m). So for each m (which is either n+1 or n+2), I can start checking from the integer part of sqrt(m) downwards until I find a divisor.\n\nLet me think. For example, if m is 10, sqrt(10) is about 3.16. So check 3: 10 divided by 3 is 3.333... not integer. Then check 2: 10/2=5. So the pair is (2,5), difference is 3. But wait, 1 and 10 is also a pair, but their difference is 9, which is bigger.

Then the pair would be (divisor, m/divisor). The difference between them would be m/divisor - divisor. We need the pair with the smallest difference.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. For m1 = n+1 and m2 = n+2:\n   a. Find the closest divisor pair for m1.\n   b. Find the closest divisor pair for m2.\n2. Compare the two pairs (from m1 and m2) based on how close the two numbers are (i.e., the smaller the difference between the two numbers, the better).\n3. Return the pair with the smallest difference. If both have the same difference, perhaps return the one from m1 first? Wait, the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So whichever of the two m's gives the closest pair.\n\nWait, but maybe for some n, n+1's closest pair is closer than n+2's, and vice versa.\n\nSo for each m in [n+1, n+2], compute the closest pair, then compare which pair has the minimal difference.\n\nSo how to compute the closest pair for a given m.\n\nLet me think of how to find the closest divisor pair for m.\n\nStart from the integer part of sqrt(m), and go down to 1. The first divisor we find will give the pair (d, m//d), and since we're starting from sqrt(m) downwards, the first d that divides m will be the largest possible d <= sqrt(m), so m//d will be the smallest possible >= sqrt(m). Therefore, the difference (m//d - d) will be minimized.\n\nYes. So for example, m=15. sqrt(15) is ~3.872. Check 3: 15/3=5, which is integer. So pair (3,5), difference 2. Which is the closest possible.\n\nAnother example: m=12. sqrt is ~3.464. Check 3: 12/3=4, so (3,4), difference 1. Which is the closest.\n\nSo the algorithm for a given m is:\n\n- Compute sqrt_m = int(math.isqrt(m))\n- Iterate d from sqrt_m down to 1:\n   - if m % d == 0:\n      return (d, m//d)\n\nSo for each m, this gives the closest pair.\n\nThen, for the problem, we compute the closest pair for m1 = n+1 and m2 = n+2, then compare which pair has the smaller difference (i.e., (b - a) for (a, b)), and return the pair with the smaller difference. If the differences are equal, then perhaps either is acceptable, but according to the problem statement, it's possible that both m1 and m2 have pairs with the same difference. The problem says \"closest\", so we need to choose the pair where the two numbers are closest. If both pairs have same difference, perhaps the problem expects either, but the problem statement says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So if both options are equally close, then either is acceptable. However, the problem may have a unique answer, but in code we need to handle that.\n\nWait, but perhaps for some n, both m1 and m2 have the same minimal difference, but which one to choose? Let's see. For example, take n=1.

I need to define a function called closest_divisors that takes an integer n and returns a tuple of two integers. The two integers should be divisors of either n+1 or n+2, and their product should be exactly n+1 or n+2. Also, among all possible pairs for both n+1 and n+2, I need the pair that's closest to each other (i.e., the two numbers have the smallest absolute difference).\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem. For a given n, compute n+1 and n+2. For each of those two numbers (let's call them m1 = n+1 and m2 = n+2), find all possible pairs of divisors (a, b) such that a * b = m. Then, among all those pairs for both m1 and m2, select the pair where the difference between a and b is the smallest. If there's a tie, maybe pick either? Wait, the problem says \"closest\", so if two pairs have the same difference, perhaps we need to choose the one from the smaller m? Or maybe it doesn't matter as long as they are closest. Hmm, but the problem statement says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So the closest possible pair between the two options.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For m in [n+1, n+2]:\n   a. Find all pairs of divisors (a, b) where a <= b and a * b = m.\n   b. Among these pairs, find the one with the smallest (b - a).\n2. Compare the closest pairs from m1 and m2, and return the pair with the smallest difference.\n\nBut how to find the closest divisors for a number m?\n\nThe closest divisors of a number m would be around the square root of m. Because the pair of divisors closest to each other are the ones where a is as large as possible without exceeding sqrt(m). For example, for m=12, sqrt(12) is ~3.464. The divisors are (1,12), (2,6), (3,4). The closest pair is (3,4) with difference 1.\n\nSo the approach for each m is to iterate from the integer part of sqrt(m) downwards, and check if m is divisible by i. The first i where m % i == 0 will give the pair (i, m//i), which is the closest possible pair for m.\n\nYes, because as we go down from sqrt(m), the first divisor we find will pair with the smallest possible quotient, hence the two numbers will be closest.\n\nSo for each m (n+1 and n+2), compute the closest pair, then compare the two pairs (from m1 and m2) and return the one with the smaller difference.\n\nLet's test with an example. Let's say n=8.\n\nn+1=9, n+2=10.\n\nFor 9: sqrt(9)=3. 9%3=0, so pair (3,3). Difference 0.\n\nFor 10: sqrt(10) ~3.16. Check 3: 10%3=1. 2: 10%2=0, so pair (2,5), difference 3.\n\nSo the closest pair is (3,3) from 9. So the function should return (3,3).\n\nAnother example: n=1. Then n+1=2, n+2=3.\n\nFor 2: closest pair (1,2), difference 1.\n\nFor 3: (1,3), difference 2.\n\nSo return (1,2).\n\nAnother example: n=5. n+1=6, n+2=7.\n\nFor 6: sqrt(6) ~2.45. Check 2: 6%2=0 → (2,3), difference 1.\n\nFor 7: (1,7), difference 6.\n\nSo return (2,3).\n\nWait, but what if both m1 and m2 have pairs with the same difference? Like n=14. n+1=15, n+2=16.\n\nFor 15: sqrt(15) ~3.87. Check 3: 15%3=0 → (3,5), difference 2.\n\nFor 16: sqrt(16)=4 → (4,4), difference 0. So return (4,4).\n\nAnother case: n=3. n+1=4, n+2=5.\n\n4's closest is (2,2), difference 0. 5's is (1,5), difference 4. So return (2,2).\n\nAnother test: n=2. n+1=3, n+2=4.\n\n3's pair (1,3), diff 2. 4's (2,2), diff 0.

Then the pair is (i, m//i).\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nFor m1 = n+1:\n\n   a = find_closest_pair(m1)\n\nFor m2 = n+2:\n\n   b = find_closest_pair(m2)\n\nCompare the differences of a and b, return the pair with smaller difference.\n\nIf differences are equal, which one to return?

For each of these numbers, find the pair of divisors that are closest to each other (i.e., the pair with the smallest difference), and then compare the two pairs from n+1 and n+2 to see which one is closer.\n\nWait, right. Because the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So we have to check both possibilities (n+1 and n+2), find the closest pair for each, then pick the pair with the smaller difference between the two numbers.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to find the closest divisors for a given number m. For a number m, the closest divisors would be around the square root of m. Because the square root is where the two factors are equal (if m is a perfect square), so the closest pair would be the factors around sqrt(m).\n\nSo for a number m, to find the closest divisors:\n\n1. Compute the integer square root of m, let's say s = int(sqrt(m)).\n2. Then check from s downwards to 1 to find the largest divisor of m that's less than or equal to s.\n3.

So the pair is (2,5), difference 3. But if m is 12, sqrt(12) is ~3.46.

So this function would work.\n\nSo for each m, find the pair by starting at sqrt(m) and going down.\n\nSo the steps for the main function:\n\nCompute m1 = n+1, m2 = n+2.\n\nFind pair1 = find_closest_pair(m1)\n\nFind pair2 = find_closest_pair(m2)\n\nCompute diff1 = pair1[1] - pair1[0]\n\ndiff2 = pair2[1] - pair2[0]\n\nReturn the pair with the smaller diff.

I need to define an LRUCache2 with get and put methods, similar to the classic LRU cache. First, I should recall how an LRU cache works. The main idea is that when the cache reaches its capacity, the least recently used item is evicted.\n\nSo, the classic approach uses a combination of a hash map (dictionary) and a doubly linked list. The dictionary maps keys to nodes in the linked list, which keeps track of the order of usage. When a key is accessed (get or put), it's moved to the front (most recently used), and when we need to evict, we remove the tail (least recently used).\n\nBut wait, maybe in Python, using OrderedDict from collections is a common way to implement this. Because OrderedDict has move_to_end and popitem(last=False) methods which can help. Let me think. Yes, in Python, using OrderedDict can simplify the implementation since it maintains the insertion order. For get, if the key exists, we move it to the end (to mark as most recently used), and for put, if the key exists, we update it and move to end; if not, add it, and if over capacity, pop the first item (since OrderedDict's popitem with last=False removes the oldest).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"classic LRU\", so maybe they expect the traditional doubly linked list approach. However, the problem statement doesn't specify any constraints, so using OrderedDict is acceptable and more straightforward in Python.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Define LRUCache2(capacity:int) with get/put like classic LRU.\" So the user wants a class LRUCache2 that takes capacity in the constructor, and has get and put methods.\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nFor the OrderedDict approach:\n\n- Initialize with capacity, and an OrderedDict.\n- In get: if key in cache, move to end and return value; else -1.\n- In put: if key in cache, move to end and update value. Else, if at capacity, pop the first item (oldest), then add new key-value to end.\n\nWait, OrderedDict's popitem(last=False) pops the first item (the least recently used), which is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nIn __init__: self.capacity = capacity, self.cache = OrderedDict()\n\nIn get(key): if key in self.cache, move_to_end(key), return value; else -1.\n\nIn put(key, value): if key in self.cache, move_to_end(key). Then set self.cache[key] = value. If len(cache) > capacity, popitem(last=False).\n\nWait, but when putting a new item, if the key already exists, we need to update it and move to end. But in the put method, if the key exists, we should update the value and mark it as recently used. So the steps for put:\n\nCheck if key exists. If yes, move to end, then update the value. But wait, in OrderedDict, updating the value doesn't affect the order, so we need to move to end first, then update? Or move to end after updating?\n\nWait, no. Because if the key exists, we need to mark it as recently used. So when we put a new value for an existing key, we should move it to the end (to mark as most recent), then set the new value.\n\nWait, but in Python's OrderedDict, the move_to_end(key) will move the existing key to the end. Then setting the value would not affect the order. Wait, no: if you do self.cache[key] = value, that's an update, but in OrderedDict, updating an existing key does not change its position. So to update the value and mark as recently used, you need to first move it to the end, then set the value. Wait, no: moving to end is sufficient, then the value is updated.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ncache = OrderedDict()\ncache['a'] = 1\ncache['b'] = 2\ncache.move_to_end('a')  # now order is b, a\ncache['a'] = 3  # does this change the order? No, the order remains b, a. So to update the value and mark as recently used, you need to move to end first, then update the value. Wait, but moving to end after updating?\n\nWait, no. Let's think: Suppose the key exists. When you do a put operation for an existing key, you need to update its value and mark it as recently used.

Let's think about how LRU works.\n\nFirst, LRU stands for Least Recently Used. So when the cache is full and a new item is added, the least recently used item gets evicted. The get and put operations should update the usage order.\n\nThe classic way to implement this is using a combination of a hash map (dictionary) and a doubly linked list. The dictionary maps keys to nodes in the linked list. The linked list keeps the order of usage, with the most recently used at the head and least at the tail.\n\nWait, but in Python, maybe there's a simpler way using OrderedDict from collections. Oh, but the problem says \"classic LRU\", so maybe they expect the manual implementation with linked list. But sometimes people use OrderedDict for simplicity. However, since the user says \"define LRUCache2\", maybe they want a custom implementation.\n\nWait, the problem says \"minimal correct solution\". So perhaps using OrderedDict is acceptable? Because it's simpler and meets the requirements.\n\nLet me recall: OrderedDict in Python has a move_to_end method which can be used to mark a key as recently used. Also, when popping items, it pops from the left (the least recently used).\n\nSo for the LRUCache:\n\n- __init__: initialize the capacity, and an OrderedDict.\n\n- get(key): if key exists, move it to the end (recently used) and return the value. Else return -1.\n\n- put(key, value): if key exists, update it and move to end. Else, add to OrderedDict. If size exceeds capacity, pop the first item (least recently used).\n\nYes, that's the standard approach with OrderedDict.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"classic LRU\", which traditionally uses a linked list and hash map, but using OrderedDict is a common Pythonic way.\n\nSo the minimal correct solution would use OrderedDict.\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nIn the __init__:\n\nself.capacity = capacity\n\nself.cache = OrderedDict()\n\nFor get:\n\nif key in self.cache:\n\n   self.cache.move_to_end(key)\n\n   return self.cache[key]\n\nelse:\n\n   return -1\n\nFor put:\n\nif key in self.cache:\n\n   self.cache.move_to_end(key)\n\nself.cache[key] = value\n\nif len(self.cache) > self.capacity:\n\n   self.cache.popitem(last=False)\n\nWait, but when putting a new key, if it's already present, we update it and move to end. If it's new, add and check size.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but when key is present, we should update the value and move to end. So in put:\n\nif key in self.cache:\n\n   self.cache.move_to_end(key)\n\nself.cache[key] = value  # This updates the value even if key exists.\n\nThen check if size exceeds capacity.\n\nWait, but if the key is already present, the size doesn't change. So the pop should only happen when adding a new key that causes the size to exceed capacity.\n\nSo the correct order is:\n\nIn put:\n\nif key in self.cache:\n\n   self.cache.move_to_end(key)\n\nself.cache[key] = value\n\nif len(self.cache) > self.capacity:\n\n   self.cache.popitem(last=False)\n\nYes. Because if the key exists, updating it doesn't increase the size, so no need to pop. Only when the size exceeds capacity after adding a new key.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nclass LRUCache2:\n    def __init__(self, capacity: int):\n        self.capacity = capacity\n        self.cache = OrderedDict()\n\n    def get(self, key: int) -> int:\n        if key in self.cache:\n            self.cache.move_to_end(key)\n            return self.cache[key]\n        return -1\n\n    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:\n        if key in self.cache:\n            self.cache.move_to_end(key)\n        self.cache[key] = value\n        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:\n            self.cache.popitem(last=False)\n\nWait, but in Python, OrderedDict's popitem(last=False) removes the first item, which is the least recently used.\n\nYes. So this should work.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\n- capacity 0?

The most recently used items are near the head, and the least recently used are near the tail.\n\nWait, but in Python, there's also an OrderedDict from the collections module which can be used to track the order of insertion. That might simplify things. Let me think. Yes, OrderedDict has a move_to_end method which can mark a key as recently used, and popping the first item (which is the oldest) when the cache is full.\n\nSo the steps for the class:\n\n- __init__: initialize the capacity, and an OrderedDict.\n- get: if key in cache, move it to end (recently used) and return value.

When you access an item (get), you need to move it to the end to mark it as recently used.

So in the put method, first check if key exists. If yes, move to end before updating? Or does updating the value automatically keep it in place? Wait, no. If the key exists, we need to move it to the end (mark as recently used) before updating. Wait, but in the code above, for the put method, if key is in cache, we move to end, then set the value. Wait, but setting the value would not affect the order. Wait, but when you do self.cache[key] = value, if the key exists, it updates the value but doesn't change the order. So to update the order, you need to move it to the end first.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the key exists. So first, we move it to the end (so it's marked as recently used), then update the value. But moving to end is part of the get operation. Wait, in the put method, when updating an existing key, we should mark it as recently used. So yes, the code should move it to the end before updating the value? Or does the order get updated when you access it?\n\nWait, no. When you do self.cache.move_to_end(key), that moves it to the end (recently used). Then, when you set self.cache[key] = value, does that affect the order? In OrderedDict, updating the value of an existing key does not change its position. So the correct approach is: if the key exists, move it to the end (to mark as recently used), then update the value. Wait, but moving it to the end is sufficient, and then setting the value doesn't affect the order.\n\nWait, let's look at the OrderedDict documentation. The move_to_end method moves an existing key to either end of the ordered dictionary. The 'last' parameter: if True, move to the right end (most recent); if False, to the left (oldest).

I need to implement an LRUCache2 with get and put methods, similar to the classic LRU cache. Hmm, LRU stands for Least Recently Used, right? So the cache should evict the least recently used item when it's full and a new item is added.\n\nFirst, I remember that the common way to implement an LRU cache is using a combination of a hash map (dictionary in Python) and a doubly linked list. The dictionary allows O(1) access to the nodes, and the doubly linked list helps in maintaining the order of usage, so we can quickly move the most recently used items to the front and evict from the end.\n\nWait, but in Python, there's also the OrderedDict from the collections module, which can be used to simulate the LRU behavior by moving items to the end when they're accessed. But the problem says \"classic LRU\", so maybe they want the actual implementation without relying on OrderedDict. Because sometimes in interviews, they ask you to implement it from scratch.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For the get method: if the key exists, return the value and mark it as recently used (move it to the front). If not, return -1.\n\n2. For the put method: if the key exists, update the value and mark as recently used. If it doesn't, add the new key-value pair. If the cache is at capacity, remove the least recently used item (the tail of the linked list) before adding the new one.\n\nSo the data structures needed are:\n\n- A dictionary (hash map) to map keys to nodes in the linked list.\n- A doubly linked list where each node has key, value, prev, and next pointers.\n\nLet me outline the classes needed.\n\nFirst, a Node class for the doubly linked list. Each node has key, value, prev, next.\n\nThen, the LRUCache2 class which has:\n\n- capacity: int\n- cache: dict to store key -> Node\n- head and tail pointers for the doubly linked list. Maybe we can have dummy head and tail to simplify edge cases.\n\nWait, using dummy head and tail nodes can make the insertion and deletion easier because we don't have to check for null pointers as much.\n\nSo, when initializing LRUCache2, we set up the head and tail as dummy nodes, linked to each other.\n\nFor example:\n\nhead <-> tail\n\nWhen we add a new node, we add it right after head.\n\nWhen we need to evict, we remove the node before tail.\n\nSo, the steps for get:\n\n- Check if key is in cache.\n- If yes, remove the node from its current position, add it right after head (mark as most recently used), then return the value.\n- If not, return -1.\n\nFor put:\n\n- If key exists, update the value, then move the node to front (same as get).\n- Else, create a new node. If the cache is full (len(cache) == capacity), remove the least recently used (the node before tail), then add the new node to front.\n- Add the new node to the cache.\n\nWait, but when the cache is at capacity, we have to check before adding a new item. So in put, when adding a new key (not present), first check if the size is equal to capacity. If yes, evict the tail's prev node.\n\nNow, the methods to manage the linked list:\n\n- _remove_node(node): removes the node from the linked list.\n- _add_to_head(node): adds the node right after the head.\n\nWait, in some implementations, the head is the most recently used, and tail is least. So adding to head makes it MRU.\n\nWait, let's clarify the linked list structure.\n\nLet's say the head is a dummy node, and the actual MRU is head.next. The tail is a dummy node, and the actual LRU is tail.prev.\n\nSo when you get a key, you move that node to between head and head.next.\n\nSo, the order is: head -> MRU -> ... -> LRU -> tail.\n\nSo, when adding a new node, it's placed right after head.\n\nWhen evicting, we remove tail.prev.\n\nSo, the helper functions:\n\n_remove_node(node):\n\nprev_node = node.prev\n\nnext_node = node.next\n\nprev_node.next = next_node\n\nnext_node.prev = prev_node\n\n_add_node(node):\n\n# Insert right after head\n\nfirst_node = head.next\n\nhead.next = node\n\nnode.prev = head\n\nnode.next = first_node\n\nfirst_node.prev = node\n\nWait, yes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef _remove_node(self, node):\n\nprev = node.prev\n\nnxt = node.next\n\nprev.next = nxt\n\nnxt.prev = prev\n\ndef _a", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.17333333333333334, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 2298, "metadata": {"tests": ["c=LRUCache2(2); c.put(1,1); c.put(2,2); assert c.get(1)==1; c.put(3,3); assert c.get(2)==-1; c.put(4,4); assert c.get(1)==-1 and c.get(3)==3 and c.get(4)==4"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

The minimal period p is the smallest integer such that the string s can be formed by repeating the prefix of length p. For example, if s is \"ababab\", the minimal period is 2 because \"ab\" repeats three times.\n\nFirst, let's think about what conditions must be met for a period p to be valid. The length of the string, n, should be divisible by p. So n % p must be 0. Then, for each i from 0 to n-1, the character at position i should be equal to the character at position i mod p.\n\nSo the approach would be: iterate p from 1 to n (but maybe up to n//2 since the period can't be longer than n, but the minimal might be less). Wait, the maximum possible period is n itself (if the string has no repetition), but the problem says \"smallest p such that s is repeats of prefix length p\". So for a string like \"abc\", the minimal period is 3 because it can't be broken down into smaller repeating parts.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"smallest p such that s is repeats of prefix length p\". So for \"abc\", the only possible p is 3, since \"abc\" repeated once is \"abc\".\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each possible p starting from 1 up to len(s), check if len(s) is divisible by p.

Possible p could be 2 (since 4/2=2). If p=1, check if all characters are same. For \"abab\", p=1 would not work.\n\nSo the algorithm:\n\nFor p in 1 to n:\n\n   if n % p != 0: continue\n\n   Check if s is equal to s[0:p] repeated (n/p) times.\n\n   If yes, then p is a valid period. We need the smallest such p.\n\nSo the minimal p is the smallest one where this condition holds.\n\nSo for the function minimal_period(s), we can iterate p from 1 to n, check divisibility, then check if the string is composed of the prefix repeated.\n\nBut how to check efficiently?\n\nFor example, for each p where n % p == 0, check if for all i in 0..n-1, s[i] == s[i % p].\n\nSo the code could be:\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor p in range(1, n+1):\n\n    if n % p != 0:\n\n        continue\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if s[i] != s[i % p]:\n\n            valid = False\n\n            break\n\n    if valid:\n\n        return p\n\nBut this might not be efficient for very long strings, but since the problem says \"minimal correct solution\", perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. For example, the minimal period is the smallest p such that s is a repetition of s[:p]. So another way is to check for all possible p that divides n (since n must be a multiple of p), and find the smallest p where s == s[:p] * (n//p).\n\nBut how to generate the possible p's?\n\nAlternatively, for p in 1 to n:\n\n   if n % p == 0:\n\n      if s == s[:p] * (n//p):\n\n          return p\n\nBut generating all p's from 1 to n and checking this condition would work.\n\nWait, but for example, if s is \"aaa\", n=3. Possible p=1: 3%1=0, s[:1] is 'a', repeated 3 times is 'aaa' which equals s. So return 1.\n\nAnother example: s = \"ababab\", n=6. p=2: 6%2=0, s[:2] is 'ab', repeated 3 times is 'ababab' which matches. So return 2.\n\nBut what about p=3? 6%3=0. s[:3] is 'aba', repeated 2 times is 'abaaba', which is not equal to 'ababab', so p=3 is invalid.\n\nSo the code would check p=1,2,3, etc., and return the first valid p.\n\nWait, but p=1: check if all characters are same. For \"ababab\", p=1 would fail because s[0] is 'a', s[1] is 'b' != 'a'.\n\nSo the code would check p=1, which fails, then p=2, which works.\n\nSo the code as described would work.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way.

So p=5 is the only option.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"s is repeats of prefix length p\". So for s to be a repetition, the length must be a multiple of p. So for n=5, p must divide 5, so possible p=1 or 5. Since p=1 doesn't work, p=5 is the answer.\n\nSo the code should check all divisors of n in order from smallest to largest.\n\nBut how to generate the possible p's? Instead of checking all numbers from 1 to n, perhaps generate all divisors of n in order.\n\nWait, but the minimal p is the smallest possible, so even if a smaller p is not a divisor, but wait no—p must divide n. Because if p is the period, then the string length must be a multiple of p. Otherwise, you can't have the string formed by repeating the prefix.\n\nWait, for example, if s is \"abcab\", n=5. Suppose someone claims p=3. Then the string would be \"abc\" repeated 5/3 times, which is not an integer, so it's impossible. So p must divide n.\n\nTherefore, the possible candidates for p are the divisors of n.\n\nSo the correct approach is to iterate through all possible divisors of n in increasing order, and check if s is formed by repeating the prefix of length p.\n\nSo how to get the divisors of n?\n\nFor example, for n=6, the divisors are 1,2,3,6.\n\nSo the code can loop p from 1 to n, check if n % p ==0.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, what's a period here? For example, if the string is \"ababab\", the minimal period is 2 because \"ab\" repeats three times. Another example: \"abcabc\" has period 3. If the string is \"aaa\", the period is 1. But if the string is \"abcd\", the period is 4 since it doesn't repeat.\n\nSo the problem is to find the smallest p where s is exactly formed by repeating the first p characters. So for s to have period p, the length of s must be a multiple of p. Wait, no. Wait, if the string is \"abab\", length 4. p=2, which divides 4. So yes, the length must be divisible by p. So p must be a divisor of len(s). Otherwise, you can't have exact repetition.\n\nWait, but what about a string like \"abcab\"? Length 5. But 5 isn't a multiple of any p except 1 and 5. So for p=1, the string would have to be \"aaaaa\", which it's not. So the minimal period here is 5.\n\nSo the approach would be: check all possible p values from 1 up to len(s), and find the smallest p where s is composed of the prefix s[:p] repeated k times, where k = len(s)/p. Since p must divide len(s), maybe it's more efficient to check the divisors of len(s).\n\nWait, but what if the string is \"ababa\"? Length 5. The possible p's are 1,5. But maybe p=2? Let's see. If p=2, then the string would be \"ab\" repeated 2.5 times, which isn't possible. So the length must be a multiple of p. So p must divide n = len(s). So possible p's are the divisors of n.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's take an example. Suppose s = \"abcabcab\". Length is 8. The possible p's could be divisors of 8, but 8's divisors are 1,2,4,8. Let's see:\n\nIf p=2, then the string should be \"ab\" repeated 4 times: \"abababab\", but our string is \"abcabcab\", which is different. So p=2 isn't valid.\n\nBut maybe p=3? Wait, 8 isn't divisible by 3. So p=3 is not possible. So the minimal period here would be 8, but wait, maybe p=5? No, because 8 isn't divisible by 5. So the possible p's are only the divisors of n.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem allows p where n is not a multiple of p. Wait, the problem says \"s is repeats of prefix length p\". So for example, if s is \"abab\", then p=2, and the string is \"ab\" repeated twice. But if the string is \"ababa\", which is length 5, then the prefix of length 2 is \"ab\", but \"ababa\" is \"ab\" repeated 2.5 times, which isn't possible. So the problem must require that the entire string is exactly formed by repeating the prefix, so the length of the string must be a multiple of p. Therefore, p must divide n.\n\nSo the correct approach is to check all possible divisors of n (the length of s) in increasing order, and find the smallest p such that s is composed of the prefix s[:p] repeated n/p times.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the string is \"aabaab\", length 6. The minimal period is 3, since \"aab\" repeated twice. But 3 divides 6. So that's correct.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each possible p from 1 to n (where n = len(s)), check if p is a divisor of n.\n\nWait, but checking all p from 1 to n might be inefficient for large n, but given that the problem says \"minimal correct solution\", maybe it's acceptable for small n. However, since the problem is to find the minimal p, perhaps a better approach is to iterate p from 1 to n, and check if s is equal to (s[:p] * (n//p)). But for p that doesn't divide n, n//p would be floor division, which would not give the exact length. So for example, if n=5 and p=2, n//p is 2, so s[:p] * 2 is length 4, which is shorter than 5. So such p's can be skipped.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that s is exactly the repetition of the prefix. Therefore, p must divide n. So for each p that divides n, check if s equals (s[:p] * (n//p)). Then the smallest such p is the minimal period.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each possible p in 1, 2, ..., n:\n\n   - if n % p == 0:\n\n      - check if s == s[:p] * (n // p)\n\n      - if yes, return p\n\nBut since we need the smallest p, we can iterate p from 1", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.17333333333333334, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 1677, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert minimal_period('ababab')==2"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

I need to write a function called minimal_period(s) that returns the smallest period p such that the string s is made by repeating the prefix of length p.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a period is here. The minimal period p means that if you take the first p characters of s and repeat them enough times, you get the entire string s. And p should be the smallest such number.\n\nFor example, if s is \"ababab\", then the minimal period is 2 because \"ab\" repeated three times gives the string.\n\nSo, the approach here is to check for possible p values from 1 up to len(s), and find the smallest p where the string can be divided into equal parts of length p, each part equal to the first p characters.\n\nWait, but how do I check if p is a valid period?\n\nLet me think. For a given p, the length of the string s must be a multiple of p. So len(s) % p should be 0. If not, p can't be a period.\n\nThen, for each i from 0 to len(s)-1, s[i] should equal s[i % p]. Because the string is the prefix repeated.\n\nAlternatively, the string s should be equal to s[:p] * (len(s) // p).\n\nSo, for each possible p starting from 1 up to len(s), check if len(s) is divisible by p, and then check if s equals the repetition of the first p characters.\n\nBut since we need the minimal p, we can iterate p from 1 upwards and return the first p that satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, but the minimal period might not be a divisor of len(s)? Wait, no. Because if the string is exactly composed of the prefix repeated, then len(s) must be a multiple of p. So p must divide len(s). So possible p's are the divisors of len(s).\n\nWait, but maybe not necessarily. Wait, for example, if s is \"aaa\", then p=1. len(s) is 3, which is divisible by 1. So yes, p must divide len(s).\n\nWait, another example: s = \"ababa\". Wait, len(s) is 5. Let's see. If p=2: \"ab\" repeated 2.5 times? But that's not possible. So the string can't be formed by repeating a prefix of length 2. So p must divide the length of the string.\n\nTherefore, the possible candidates for p are the divisors of len(s). But wait, perhaps not exactly. Wait, let's take s = \"abcabcabc\". len(s) is 9. The minimal period is 3. 9 is divisible by 3. So yes.\n\nAnother example: s = \"aabaab\". len(s) is 6. The minimal period is 3 (aab), but 6 is divisible by 3. So yes.\n\nWait, but what about s = \"abab\"? len(s)=4. The minimal period is 2. 4 is divisible by 2.\n\nSo, in all cases where the string is periodic, the period p must divide the length of the string. Therefore, the possible p's to check are the divisors of len(s), ordered from smallest to largest.\n\nBut wait, is that true? Suppose s is \"abcabcab\". len(s) = 8. Let's see. If p=3, then 8 is not divisible by 3. So the string can't be exactly formed by repeating the prefix of length 3. So in that case, the minimal period would have to be 8 (the whole string), because there's no smaller p that divides 8 and satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, but \"abcabcab\" is \"abc\" repeated 2 times (6 characters) plus \"ab\". So it's not a full repetition, so the minimal period would be 8. So in that case, the period is the entire string.\n\nSo the conclusion is that for the minimal period p, p must be such that len(s) is divisible by p, and the string is composed of the prefix repeated len(s)/p times.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm should check for p in the divisors of len(s), starting from the smallest possible.\n\nWait, but how to find the divisors of len(s) in order? Because the minimal p is the smallest divisor of len(s) for which the string is composed of the prefix repeated.\n\nWait, but the divisors of n (len(s)) are all numbers from 1 to n that divide n. So for example, n=6 has divisors 1,2,3,6.\n\nSo the approach is: iterate p from 1 to n, check if p divides n, and if s is equal to s[:p] * (n//p). The first such p is the minimal period.\n\nWait, but for p=1: check if all characters are the same. For example, \"aaaa\" has p=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Let n = len(s).\n\n2.

But wait, if each list has n elements, then the total combinations would be O(n^4), which is way too slow for large n. Like, if n is 100, that's 100 million operations. Not feasible for bigger inputs.\n\nSo I need a smarter way. Let me think. Maybe split the problem into two parts. Like, compute all possible sums from A and B, then all possible sums from C and D, and then see how they can add up to zero.\n\nOh right! Because if A[i] + B[j] = x, then we need C[k] + D[l] = -x. So if I can count how many times each sum occurs in A+B and in C+D, then for each x in A+B, multiply the count of x by the count of -x in C+D.\n\nLet me break it down. First, create a dictionary (or a defaultdict) for the sums of A and B. For each element a in A and b in B, compute a + b and increment the count in the dictionary.\n\nThen do the same for C and D: compute all sums c + d and store their counts in another dictionary.\n\nWait, but maybe even better: after getting the first dictionary (for A+B), then for each sum in C+D, check if the negative of that sum is in the first dictionary. But perhaps it's more efficient to process the second part on the fly.\n\nWait, the standard approach for 4Sum II problem (which this is) is to split into two pairs. Let me recall. Yes, the problem is similar to LeetCode 454. The solution is O(n^2) time.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute all possible sums of A[i] + B[j], store in a dictionary (sum_ab) where keys are the sums and values are the counts.\n\n2. For each sum in C[k] + D[l], check if -(that sum) exists in sum_ab. If yes, add the count from sum_ab to the total.\n\nWait, but actually, for each sum_cd = c + d, the required sum_ab is -sum_cd. So total += sum_ab.get(-sum_cd, 0).\n\nSo the total steps would be O(n^2) for building the first dictionary, and O(n^2) for processing the second part, which is acceptable.\n\nLet me verify with an example.\n\nSuppose A = [1,2], B = [-2,-1], C = [-1,2], D = [0,2].\n\nA+B sums: 1 + (-2) = -1; 1 + (-1) = 0; 2 + (-2) = 0; 2 + (-1) =1.

Add 1.\n\nsum_cd=2: need sum_ab=-2. sum_ab doesn't have -2, so 0.\n\nsum_cd=4: need sum_ab=-4, which isn't present.

Then C[k] + D[l] must be 1. Which C+D sums to 1? C[0]=-1, D[1]=2: -1+2=1. So that's one tuple: (0,0,0,1).\n\nAnother: A[1]=2, B[0]=-2: sum_ab=0. Need sum_cd=0. But C+D sums to 0? Let's see. C[0]=-1 and D[0]=0: sum is -1. C[1]=2 and D[0]=0: 2. No. So sum_cd=0 isn't present. So no tuples here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait sum_ab for A[1] + B[1] = 2 + (-1) =1. sum_cd needs to be -1. sum_cd=-1 is C[0] + D[0] = -1 +0 =-1. So tuple (1,1,0,0).

Like, if each list has 100 elements, that's 100^4 = 100,000,000 operations. Not feasible. So I need a smarter way.\n\nI remember that for problems like 4Sum, a common approach is to break it into two parts. Maybe split the four lists into two pairs. Like, compute all possible sums from A and B, then compute all possible sums from C and D, and look for pairs that add up to zero.\n\nWait, yes. Let's think: For each element in A and B, sum them up and store the frequency of each sum. Then, for each sum in C and D, check if the negative of that sum exists in the first hash map. Because if (a + b) + (c + d) = 0, then (a + b) = -(c + d).\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Create a dictionary (or defaultdict) to store the sum of all possible pairs from A and B, along with how many times each sum occurs.\n\nFor example, for each a in A and b in B, compute sum_ab = a + b, and increment the count in the dictionary.\n\n2. Then, for each c in C and d in D, compute sum_cd = c + d. For each sum_cd, check if -sum_cd exists in the dictionary. If yes, add the count from the dictionary to the total.\n\nThis way, the time complexity would be O(n^2) for each part, so overall O(n^2), which is manageable even for n up to a few hundred.\n\nLet me verify. Suppose A, B, C, D each have length n. Then the first loop is n^2, the second loop is n^2. So total O(n^2), which is much better than O(n^4).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, create a defaultdict(int) for the sum_ab counts.\n\nLoop through each element in A and B:\n\nfor a in A:\n    for b in B:\n        sum_ab = a + b\n        count_dict[sum_ab] += 1\n\nThen, initialize a total counter to 0.\n\nLoop through each element in C and D:\n\nfor c in C:\n    for d in D:\n        sum_cd = c + d\n        if -sum_cd in count_dict:\n            total += count_dict[-sum_cd]\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, let's test with a small example.\n\nSuppose A = [1], B = [-1], C = [0], D = [0].\n\nThen sum_ab is 0, count_dict[0] = 1.\n\nsum_cd for C and D is 0 + 0 = 0. Then we check if -0 (which is 0) is in count_dict. Yes, so total += 1. So the answer is 1. Which is correct, since 1 + (-1) + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nAnother example: A = [0,1], B = [0,-1], C = [0,0], D = [0,0].\n\nsum_ab pairs:\n\n0+0=0, 0+(-1)=-1, 1+0=1, 1+(-1)=0.\n\nSo count_dict: {0:2, -1:1, 1:1}.\n\nsum_cd for C and D:\n\n0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0. So sum_cd is 0 four times.\n\nFor each sum_cd=0, we check for -0=0. count_dict[0] is 2. So total += 2 * 4? Wait no: for each of the four sum_cd=0, add 2. So total 8.\n\nWait, but the actual valid tuples:\n\nEach (a, b) that sums to 0 (there are two: (0,0) and (1,-1)) paired with each (c,d) that sums to 0 (there are four: (0,0), (0,0), (0,0), (0,0)). So 2 * 4 = 8. Correct.\n\nSo the code should return 8. Which matches.\n\nOkay, so the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNeed to handle possible large lists, but since it's O(n^2), it's acceptable.\n\nImplement in Python.\n\nLet's write the code.\n\nFirst, import defaultdict if needed. But in Python, we can use a dict and handle key errors, or use defaultdict.\n\nBut since we're writing a function, perhaps using a standard dict with get.\n\nWait, but for efficiency, using defaultdict is better.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"minimal correct solution\".\n\nSo here's the code:\n\ndef four_sum_count_zero(A, B, C, D):\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count = defaultdict(int)\n    for a in A:\n        for b in B:\n            count[a + b] += 1\n    total = 0\n    for c in C:\n        for d in D:\n            total += count.get(-(c + d), 0)\n    return total\n\nWait, but in Python, the defaultdict is used here. Alternatively, using a regular dict and .get.\n\nWait, in the first part, using defaultdict(int) makes it easy to increment.\n\nYes, the code above uses defaultdict.\n\nWait, but in the second part, when we check for -(c + d), if it's", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.0, "combined_score": 0.13333333333333333, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 1151, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert four_sum_count_zero([1,2],[-2,-1],[-1,2],[0,2])==2"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

Let's see.\n\nThe brute force approach would be to check all possible combinations of the four lists. But each list can have up to n elements, so that's O(n^4) time, which is way too slow for large n. Like, if n is 100, 100^4 is 100,000,000, which might be manageable, but if n is 500, it's 62.5 billion operations. So that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, maybe I can split the problem into two parts. Like, compute all possible sums from A and B, then all possible sums from C and D, and then see how many pairs add up to zero.\n\nWait, right. For example, if I first calculate all possible sums from A and B, store them in a hash map (or dictionary) where the key is the sum and the value is the number of times that sum occurs. Then, for each sum in C and D, I can check if the negative of that sum exists in the AB sums. Because if AB_sum + CD_sum = 0, then CD_sum = -AB_sum.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute all possible sums of elements from A and B. For each a in A and b in B, sum = a + b. Store the count of each sum in a dictionary.\n\n2. Similarly, compute all possible sums from C and D. But instead of storing them, for each sum in C and D (let's call it cd_sum), check if -cd_sum exists in the AB dictionary. If it does, add the count from AB to the total.\n\nWait, but maybe it's more efficient to compute the AB sums first, then iterate through CD sums and check.\n\nLet me think. Suppose AB_sums is a dictionary where key is sum_ab, value is count. Then for each c in C and d in D, sum_cd = c + d. We need sum_ab + sum_cd = 0 => sum_ab = -sum_cd. So for each sum_cd, the number of valid AB pairs is AB_sums.get(-sum_cd, 0). So total += AB_sums.get(-sum_cd, 0).\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the time complexity would be O(n^2) for building the AB dictionary, and O(n^2) for processing CD, so overall O(n^2), which is much better.\n\nLet's check with an example. Suppose A = [1, -1], B = [-1, 1], C = [0, 0], D = [0, 0].\n\nAB sums: 1 + (-1) = 0, 1+1=2, -1 + (-1) = -2, -1 +1=0. So the AB dictionary would have {0: 2, 2:1, -2:1}.\n\nCD sums: 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+0=0. So sum_cd is 0 for all. Then for each 0, we look for -0=0 in AB. The count is 2. There are 4 CD pairs, so total is 4 * 2 = 8. Let's see: the tuples would be (0,0,0,0), (0,0,0,1), (0,0,1,0), (0,0,1,1), (1,1,0,0), etc. Wait, but AB has two 0s (from (0,1) and (1,0) maybe?), so each of the 4 CD pairs can pair with 2 AB pairs, so 8 total. That seems correct.\n\nAnother example: A = [0], B = [0], C = [0], D = [0]. Then AB sum is 0, CD sum is 0. So total is 1 (AB count) * 1 (CD count) = 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems valid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, create a dictionary for AB sums. For each a in A and b in B, compute a + b and increment the count in the dictionary.\n\nThen, for each c in C and d in D, compute c + d, and check if -(c + d) is in the AB dictionary. If yes, add the count to the total.\n\nWait, but in code, it's sum_cd = c + d, and we want sum_ab = -sum_cd. So for each sum_cd, total += ab_dict.get(-sum_cd, 0).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef four_sum_count_zero(A, B, C, D):\n    ab_sums = {}\n    for a in A:\n        for b in B:\n            total_ab = a + b\n            ab_sums[total_ab] = ab_sums.get(total_ab, 0) + 1\n    count = 0\n    for c in C:\n        for d in D:\n            total_cd = c + d\n            count += ab_sums.get(-total_cd, 0)\n    return count\n\nWait, but what if the sum is not present? The get method returns 0, so that's handled.\n\nLet me test with the first example. A = [1, -1], B = [-1, 1], so ab_sums:\n\n1 + (-1) = 0 → count 1\n\n1 + 1 = 2 → count 1\n\n-1 + (-1) = -2 → count 1\n\n-1 + 1 = 0 → count 2\n\nSo ab_sums is {0:2, 2:1, -2:1}\n\nC and D are [0,0] each. So CD sums are 0+0=0 (four times). For each, -0 is 0, which is in ab_sums with count 2. So 4 * 2 = 8. The code returns 8, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: A = [0], B = [0], C = [0], D = [0]. ab_sums has {0:1}. CD sum is 0. count += 1. So returns 1.

This lets us answer queries while also allowing updates to the underlying data.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, size=0):\n        self.val = val\n        self.size = size\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\nclass PersistentST:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = None\n    \n    def build(self, nums):\n        self.root = self._build_helper(nums, 0, len(nums))\n    \n    def _build_helper(self, nums, start, end):\n        if start == end:\n            return Node(nums[start], 1)\n        \n        mid = (start + end) // 2\n        node = Node(0, end - start)\n        node.left = self._build_helper(nums, start, mid)\n        node.right = self._build_helper(nums, mid, end)\n        return node\n    \n    def update(self, nums, index, value):\n        new_root = self._update_helper(nums, index, value, self.root)\n        self.root = new_root\n    \n    def _update_helper(self, nums, index, value, node):\n        if node is None:\n            return None\n        \n        if index < node.size:\n            node.left = self._update_helper(nums, index, value, node.left)\n        if index >= node.size - node.size + 1:\n            node.right = self._update_helper(nums, index, value, node.right)\n        \n        if node.left is None and node.right is None:\n            node.val = value\n            node.size = 1\n            return node\n        \n        node.size = node.left.size + node.right.size\n        return node\n    \n    def query(self, node, start, end, index, k):\n        if end - start <= k:\n            return [i for i in range(index, node.size)]\n        \n        if node.left is None and node.right is None:\n            return [i for i in range(index, node.size)]\n        \n        if k <= node.left.size:\n            return self.query(node.left, start, end, index, k)\n        else:\n            return self.query(node.right, start, end, index, k)\n    \n    def query_persistent(self, nums, queries):\n        self.build(nums)\n        result = []\n        for l, r, k in queries:\n            result.append(self.query(self.root, l, r, k, k).pop())\n        return result\n```\n\nThe final answer: <short text>\n{\"final_answer\": \"Final answer: <short text>\"}", "score": 0.05, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 410, "metadata": {"tests": ["nums=[5,1,2,3,4]; qs=[(1,3,2),(0,4,3)]; assert kth_order_statistic_pst(nums,qs)==[2,3]"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}, "exec_traces": [{"test_index": 0, "returncode": 1, "stdout": "", "stderr": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/tmpl7v84yxp.py\", line 66, in <module>\n    nums=[5,1,2,3,4]; qs=[(1,3,2),(0,4,3)]; assert kth_order_statistic_pst(nums,qs)==[2,3]\n                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nNameError: name 'kth_order_statistic_pst' is not defined\n"}]}

For subarrays with even length, the median is the average of two middle values.\n\nLet's analyze the problem:\n1. For a subarray to have median k, the subarray must be sorted such that k is the middle value.\n2. Since the array is sorted, all elements are in ascending order.\n3. For a subarray of length n to have median k, the subarray must be of length n such that when n is odd, the middle element is k, or when n is even, the average of the two middle elements is k.\n\nThe key insight is that for a subarray to have median k, all elements in the subarray must be less than or equal to k (if k is the median for a subarray with odd length), or all elements in the subarray must be greater than or equal to k (if k is the median for a subarray with even length).\n\nTherefore, we can count the number of subarrays where all elements are less than or equal to k, and the number of subarrays where all elements are greater than or equal to k, and add them together to get the total number of subarrays with median k.\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef count_subarrays_with_median(nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    n = len(nums)\n    \n    # Count subarrays where all elements are less than or equal to k\n    for start in range(n):\n        for end in range(start, n):\n            if all(nums[end] <= k for end in range(start, n)):\n                count += 1\n    \n    # Count subarrays where all elements are greater than or equal to k\n    for start in range(n):\n        for end in range(start, n):\n            if all(nums[end] >= k for end in range(start, n)):\n                count += 1\n    \n    return count\n```\n\nThis implementation uses two nested loops to count all subarrays where all elements are less than or equal to k, and all subarrays where all elements are greater than or equal to k, and adds these two counts together to get the total number of subarrays with median k.\n</think>\n\nTo count subarrays where the median equals k, we need to consider the properties of medians in sorted subarrays.

Since the clock is circular, the times will \"wrap around\" the clock. For example, if we have times like 9:00 and 11:00, we need to find the minimum difference between these two times.\n\nWe can think about this in terms of angles on a circle. Each hour on a 12-hour clock represents 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 hours). Each 15-minute interval represents 5 degrees (30 degrees / 6 intervals). So the angle from the start of an hour to a given time is proportional to the minutes past the hour.\n\nTo calculate the angle of a time, we can use the following formula:\nangle = (hour % 12) * 30 + (minutes / 60) * 5\n\nTo find the minimum difference between two times, we need to find the angle difference between them. If the difference in angles is greater than 180 degrees (the clock's circumference is 360 degrees), we need to subtract the difference from 360 degrees to get the minimum difference.\n\nFor example, if we have times 9:00 and 11:00, the angle of 9:00 is 9 * 30 = 270 degrees. The angle of 11:00 is 11 * 30 + 0 * 5 = 330 degrees. The difference is 330 - 270 = 60 degrees. Since this is less than 180 degrees, this is our minimum difference.\n\nHowever, if we had times 9:00 and 1:00 (after wrapping around the clock), the angle of 9:00 is 9 * 30 = 270 degrees. The angle of 1:00 is 1 * 30 + 0 * 5 = 30 degrees. The difference is 30 - 270 = -240 degrees. Since we're looking for the minimum difference, we take the absolute value: 240 degrees. Since this is greater than 180 degrees, we subtract it from 360 degrees: 360 - 240 = 120 degrees.

When the times are on adjacent days (due to the circular nature)\n\nFor the same day, the difference is simply the absolute value of the difference between the two times.\n\nFor adjacent days, the difference is the time on the next day minus the time on the current day. For example, if the current day is \"23:59\" and the next day is \"00:00\", the difference is 23 minutes.\n\nLet's consider some examples:\n\nExample 1:\ntimes = [\"00:00\", \"23:59\"]\nThe minimum time difference is 23 minutes (between \"23:59\" and \"00:00\").\n\nExample 2:\ntimes = [\"00:00\", \"12:30\", \"23:59\"]\nThe minimum time difference is 23 minutes (between \"23:59\" and \"00:00\").\n\nSo, the function should return the minimum time difference found in the list of times.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation:\n\nWe need to:\n1. Iterate through all pairs of times in the list\n2. Calculate the time difference between each pair\n3. Return the minimum time difference found\n\nFor the time difference calculation, we need to handle the circular nature. We can do this by converting each time to minutes, and then finding the difference between them.\n\nFor example, if we have times \"00:00\" and \"23:59\", we can convert them to minutes as follows:\n- \"00:00\" = 0 minutes\n- \"23:59\" = (23 * 60) + 59 = 1439 minutes\n\nThe difference is 1439 - 0 = 1439 minutes. But since we're dealing with a circular clock, we can consider the difference between \"23:59\" and \"00:00\" as 23 minutes (which is the difference between them on the next day).\n\nSo, the function should return the minimum time difference found in the list of times.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\ndef minimum_time_difference_circular(times):\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(times)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(times)):\n            t1 = parse_time(times[i])\n            t2 = parse_time(times[j])\n            diff = abs(t2 - t1) % (24 * 60)  # Consider the circular nature\n            min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)\n    return min_diff\n\ndef parse_time(time_str):\n    hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n```\n\nBut wait, there's a problem with this implementation. The minimum time difference on a circular clock is not necessarily the difference between two times on the same day. It could be the difference between two times on adjacent days.\n\nFor example, if we have times \"00:00\" and \"23:59\", the minimum time difference is 23 minutes (between \"23:59\" and \"00:00\").\n\nSo, the function should return the minimum time difference found in the list of times.\n\nLet's revise the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef minimum_time_difference_circular(times):\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(times)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(times)):\n            t1 = parse_time(times[i])\n            t2 = parse_time(times[j])\n            diff = abs(t2 - t1) % (24 * 60)  # Consider the circular nature\n            min_diff = min(min_diff, diff)\n    return min_diff\n\ndef parse_time(time_str):\n    hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n```\n\nBut wait, there's another problem with this implementation.

The key difference from a standard clock is that it wraps around after 24 hours.\n\nTo solve this:\n1. Parse the input times into minutes since midnight\n2. Calculate the minimum difference considering the circular nature (time wraps after 1440 minutes)\n3. If the difference between the two times is greater than 1440 minutes, consider the smaller wrapped time difference\n\nFor example:\n- If time A is 23:59 and time B is 00:01, the difference is 2 minutes\n- If time A is 23:59 and time B is 24:01, the difference is 2 minutes (after wrapping)\n</think>\n\nThe problem is asking us to find the minimum time difference between two times on a circular clock. The key insight is that the circular clock wraps after 24 hours (1440 minutes), so we need to consider this wraparound when calculating the minimum difference.\n\nHere's a solution:\n\n```python\ndef minimum_time_difference_circular(times):\n    # Convert times to minutes since midnight\n    minutes = []\n    for time in times:\n        hours, mins = map(int, time.split(':'))\n        minutes.append(hours * 60 + mins)\n    \n    # Sort the times to make finding the minimum difference easier\n    minutes.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize minimum difference\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    \n    # Check all possible pairs of times\n    for i in range(len(minutes)):\n        # Calculate difference considering wraparound\n        diff1 = minutes[(i + 1) % len(minutes)] - minutes[i]\n        diff2 = minutes[(i + len(minutes) - 1) % len(minutes)] - minutes[i]\n        min_diff = min(min_diff, diff1, diff2)\n    \n    return min_diff\n```\n\nThe solution sorts the times in ascending order and checks all possible pairs, considering both the next time and the previous time (due to wraparound). The minimum difference is then returned.\n\nThis approach ensures we find the true minimum difference on a circular clock, where the time difference wraps around after 24 hours.\n\nFinal answer: {\"final_answer\": \"The function minimum_time_difference_circular calculates the minimum time difference between two times on a circular clock, considering wraparound.\"}", "score": 0.05, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 325, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert minimum_time_difference_circular(['23:59','00:00'])==1"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}, "exec_traces": [{"test_index": 0, "returncode": 1, "stdout": "", "stderr": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/tmpun4xvz0x.py\", line 24, in <module>\n    assert minimum_time_difference_circular(['23:59','00:00'])==1\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAssertionError\n"}]}

For each envelope, we look back at the envelopes we've seen so far and find the maximum area possible using that envelope and one of the previously seen envelopes.\n\nHere's the code:\n\n```python\ndef max_envelopes(envelopes: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> int:\n    # Sort envelopes by width in ascending order\n    envelopes.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    # Initialize dp array with heights of first envelope\n    dp = [height for _, height in envelopes]\n    \n    # Initialize maximum area\n    max_area = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through all envelopes\n    for i in range(len(envelopes)):\n        # Look back at previously seen envelopes (in ascending order of width)\n        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n            # If height of current envelope is greater than height of previous envelope\n            if height[i] > height[j]:\n                # Update dp value\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], width[j] * height[j])\n                # Update maximum area\n                max_area = max(max_area, dp[i])\n    \n    return max_area\n```\n\nLet me verify with some test cases:\n\nTest Case 1:\nInput: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (4, 7)]\nExpected Output: 16 (using (4, 7) and (6, 5))\n\nTest Case 2:\nInput: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]\nExpected Output: 4 (using (3, 3) and (2, 2))\n\nTest Case 3:\nInput: [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]\nExpected Output: 0 (no valid configuration possible)\n\nFinal answer: The maximum area of rectangular envelopes that can be placed such that no envelope sticks out beyond the previous one in terms of height and width is obtained by sorting the envelopes by width and then using dynamic programming to find the maximum area possible.\n</think>\n\nThis problem requires finding the maximum area of rectangular envelopes that can be placed such that no envelope sticks out beyond the previous one in terms of height and width.\n\nHere's how to solve it:\n\n1.

I need to find the minimal number of adjacent swaps required to group identical letters together in a string. And I have to choose the best letter to group, meaning the one that requires the least swaps.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. For example, if the string is \"abacab\", maybe grouping all 'a's together would take fewer swaps than grouping 'b's or 'c's.\n\nWait, the problem says \"choose the best letter\", so the answer is the minimum swaps needed for any letter. So for each distinct character in the string, calculate the minimal swaps required to group all instances of that character together, then take the smallest among those.\n\nNow, how to calculate the minimal adjacent swaps to group a particular character?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a character, say 'a', and in the string s, the positions of 'a's are at indices [i1, i2, ..., ik]. When we group them together, they should occupy consecutive positions. But where exactly? The minimal swaps would depend on the target positions.\n\nWait, but for adjacent swaps, the minimal number of swaps to bring all the 'a's together is equivalent to moving them to a consecutive block, and the optimal position for that block is around the median of their original positions. Because the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.\n\nWait, yes. For example, if we have positions [1,3,5], the median is 3. If we move them to positions 2,3,4, then each element's distance is |1-2| + |3-3| + |5-4| = 1+0+1=2. But if we move to 1,2,3, it's 0+1+2=3. So median is better.\n\nWait, the minimal total distance is achieved when the target positions are centered around the median. So for grouping, the optimal target positions for the k elements are from m - (k//2) to m + (k - k//2 -1), where m is the median. But maybe it's easier to model this as follows:\n\nFor a given character, collect all the indices where it occurs. Let's say there are m occurrences, so positions p0, p1, ..., p_{m-1} in sorted order.\n\nWhen grouped, they should be in consecutive positions. Let's say the leftmost position of the group is x. Then the target positions are x, x+1, ..., x + m -1.\n\nThe total number of swaps required is the sum of |pi - (x + i)| for i from 0 to m-1.\n\nWe need to find x that minimizes this sum.\n\nBut x has to be such that x + m -1 <= n-1 (where n is the length of the string). However, the minimal sum occurs when the target positions are as close as possible to the original positions. So the optimal x is such that the target block is centered around the median of the pi's.\n\nAlternatively, there's a known formula for this. For the minimal total distance, when moving points to consecutive positions, the minimal sum is achieved when the target block is placed such that the median of the original positions aligns with the median of the target block.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. For the positions p0 <= p1 <= ... <= p_{k-1}, the minimal total distance is sum_{i=0}^{k-1} |p_i - (m + i)|, where m is chosen such that the target positions are m, m+1, ..., m +k-1.\n\nWait, but how to find m?\n\nAlternatively, consider that when grouping the k elements, the relative order of the elements doesn't change (since we are only swapping adjacent elements, which doesn't change the order of identical elements). So the first occurrence of the character will end up at position x, the second at x+1, etc.\n\nThe minimal total distance is sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (p_i - (x + i)) if p_i >= x +i, but absolute value.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal x is p_{mid} - mid, where mid is the middle index. For example, if k is the number of elements, mid = k//2.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose positions are [0, 2, 3, 5], so k=4. The median positions would be between 2 and 3. The target block should be placed such that the middle of the block aligns with the median of the original positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal target positions are centered at the median of the original positions.

Let's say we have a string like 'abacab'. Let's take 'a' which appears at positions 0, 2, 4. To group all 'a's together, we need to bring them next to each other.

For example, if we have k occurrences of a letter, the target positions would be a consecutive block. The optimal block is such that the sum of distances from each occurrence to the target block is minimized.\n\nWait, adjacent swaps are equivalent to the total distance each element has to move, but since swaps are adjacent, each swap moves an element by one. However, when moving multiple elements, their movements can interfere.

Let's say the target positions are t_0, t_1, ..., t_{k-1}, where t_i = m + i for some m. The sum of |p_i - t_i| for all i would give the total number of swaps needed, because each element has to move from p_i to t_i, and each adjacent swap moves it one step.\n\nBut how to choose m such that this sum is minimized?\n\nLet’s consider the example where the positions are [0, 2, 4]. Let's say k=3. The target positions should be three consecutive numbers. Let's suppose we choose the target to start at 1: positions 1,2,3.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"group identical letters together\"—so for a given letter, say 'a', we need all 'a's to be adjacent.

So the problem is, for each unique character in the string, compute the minimal adjacent swaps required to bring all instances of that character together, then pick the minimum among all those values.\n\nSo the task is: for each character c in the string, calculate the minimal swaps needed to group all c's together, then return the smallest such value.\n\nNow, how do we calculate the minimal adjacent swaps for a specific character?\n\nI remember that when you want to bring all instances of a character together, the minimal swaps can be found by considering the median position of the characters.

For example, to move an element to a certain position, the number of swaps needed is the number of elements between its current position and target position.\n\nWait, another approach: when grouping all c's together, the optimal arrangement is to have all c's consecutive, and the relative order of the non-c characters doesn't matter (since we're only concerned with the swaps needed to group c's).

For order statistics, especially the k-th smallest element in a range, the common approach is to use a segment tree that tracks the frequency of elements, and then use a technique similar to the merge sort tree but with persistence.\n\nWait, the classic approach for this problem is the \"merge sort tree\" with binary search, but that's O(log^2 n) per query. However, using a persistent segment tree (specifically a \"Fenwick tree\" or a \"segment tree\" that's built for order statistics), we can do it in O(log n) per query.

Then, traverse the two trees simultaneously to find the k-th smallest element.\n\nWait, right. The persistent segment tree here is built such that version i corresponds to the array elements from index 0 to i (assuming 0-based). So for a query [l, r], we take version r and subtract version l-1. The difference gives the counts in the interval [l, r]. Then, using binary search on the value (or traversing the segment tree), we can find the k-th smallest.\n\nBut how exactly is the persistent segment tree structured here?\n\nThe segment tree is built over the sorted unique values (after compression). Each node represents a range of values and stores the count of numbers in that range for the current version.\n\nTo build the PST:\n\n- Sort the array and get the unique values (sorted_vals).\n- For each element in the original array, we find its position in sorted_vals (using bisect).\n- We build the segment tree versions incrementally. Each version i is built by updating the position corresponding to nums[i] in the previous version.\n\nWait, but in this case, the PST is built for the entire array's values.

Then, for a query (l, r, k), we can subtract the tree at version l-1 from the tree at version r to get the count of elements in the range [l, r].

Each node in the segment tree represents a range of compressed values and stores the count of numbers in that range for the current prefix.\n\n3. For each query (l, r, k), we need to find the smallest value such that there are at least k numbers <= it in the range [l, r]. This is done by querying the difference between the segment tree at version r and version l-1.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the query is (l, r, k), so the subarray from l to r inclusive. So if the array is 0-based, the versions would be built such that version i includes nums[0..i]. Then, for query [l, r], we use version r and version l-1.\n\nBut first, the coordinate compression. Let's say sorted_vals = sorted(set(nums)), then a mapping from value to index.\n\nThen, for each element in nums, we get its compressed index.\n\nBuilding the persistent segment tree: each update inserts the compressed index into the tree. The tree is built incrementally for each element.\n\nThe persistent segment tree is typically implemented with a structure where each node has left and right children, and a count. When updating, we create new nodes along the path, copying the other child from the previous version.\n\nSo for the initial version (empty tree), we have a root. Then for each index i from 0 to n-1, we update the tree to include nums[i]'s compressed index, creating a new root for version i+1.\n\nWait, maybe versions are 1-based. Let's say version 0 is empty, version 1 is after first element, etc. So for a query [l, r], we need version r+1 minus version l.\n\nWait, if the array is 0-based, then the prefix up to index r (inclusive) is version r+1, and prefix up to l-1 is version l. So the difference gives the count in [l, r].\n\nYes.

Each version i of the segment tree represents the frequency of values in the prefix [0, i].\n\n How to answer query (l, r, k):\n   We want the k-th smallest in nums[l..r].\n   We have two trees: root[r] and root[l-1] (if l==0 then root[-1] is the empty tree).\n   Then, we traverse both trees simultaneously to find the k-th smallest.\n\n Implementation details:\n   - We'll create a class for the node of the persistent segment tree.\n   - Alternatively, we can use arrays to store the left, right, and count (to avoid pointers and for efficiency).\n\n However, note: the problem requires a persistent segment tree over values.\n\n Steps in detail:\n\n Preprocessing:\n   Let n = len(nums)\n   Let sorted_vals = sorted(set(nums))\n   mapping: val -> index (from 0 to m-1) where m = len(sorted_vals)\n\n Building the tree:\n   We'll build a tree for the range [0, m-1] (the compressed value domain).\n\n   We'll create an array `roots` to store the root of each version (version i corresponds to prefix [0, i]).\n   The base version (version -1) is an empty tree. We'll build the base tree (all zeros) for the entire value range.\n\n   How to build the base tree?\n      We can build a complete tree for the range [0, m-1] with all zeros. But note: persistent segment trees are built dynamically.\n\n   Alternatively, we can build the base tree recursively? But we don't want to build the entire tree at once because we will update only one leaf at a time.\n\n   Instead, we build the base tree (version 0) as a single node? Actually, we build it as a static structure for the entire range? But persistent trees are built by updating from the base.\n\n   Standard approach:\n      We have a function `update` that takes a root, the current segment [l, r], the position to update, and the value to add (1 in our case). It returns a new root.\n\n   Steps for building:\n      roots[0] = update(roots[-1], 0, m-1, pos, 1)   [but we don't have roots[-1] as a tree?]\n\n   Actually, we start with an empty tree (version -1) which we can build as a static tree? Or we build the empty tree by a recursive function that builds the entire structure? \n   However, building the entire empty tree for [0, m-1] would be O(m) which is acceptable? But note: m can be up to n (if distinct) and n can be large (like 10^5) so building a full tree of size 4*m is acceptable? \n   But persistent segment trees are built dynamically so we don't build the entire tree at the beginning. We start with a null tree and then update.\n\n   How to represent the empty tree?\n      We can have a sentinel node (like None) but then we have to check. Alternatively, we can build a single node that covers [0, m-1] with count=0? Actually, we don't need to build the entire structure for the empty tree. We can build it on the fly.\n\n   Standard practice: \n      We have a function to build the base tree (the empty tree) for the entire range. But note: we don't need to build the whole tree because we are going to update only one path. So we can have a recursive function that builds the base tree as a chain? Actually, we don't build the base tree explicitly as a full tree. We start with a root that is None? Then when updating, we build the necessary nodes.\n\n   However, to avoid recursion and to have a fixed structure, we can build the base tree (version 0) as a tree that has all zeros. But we don't want to build O(m) nodes for the base because m can be large. Instead, we build the base tree as a single node that spans [0, m-1] and then when updating we split the node as needed.\n\n   Actually, we don't need to build the entire base tree.

Query (l,r,k) returns k-th smallest in nums[l..r].<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "completion": "Okay, I need to implement a function called kth_order_statistic_pst that uses a persistent segment tree to answer queries for the k-th smallest element in a subarray. Let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that a persistent segment tree (PST) is used for range queries where we want to query different versions of the data structure. In this case, the versions correspond to the elements of the array as we process them from left to right. Each version of the segment tree represents the count of elements up to that index.\n\nWait, the problem is about finding the k-th smallest in nums[l..r]. So the standard approach for this is to use a PST that's built over the sorted unique values of the array. Each node in the segment tree stores the count of elements in a certain value range. When building the PST, each version i (after processing the i-th element) has the counts for the first i elements.\n\nBut how does the query work? For a query (l, r, k), we can take the segment trees at versions r and l-1. The difference between these two trees gives the count of elements in the subarray nums[l..r]. Then, we traverse both trees simultaneously to find the k-th smallest element.\n\nRight. So steps needed:\n\n1. Preprocess the array: get the sorted unique values (this will be the \"values\" over which the segment tree is built).\n2. Compress the original nums array into indices corresponding to the sorted unique values. So each element becomes its rank in the sorted array.\n3. Build the persistent segment tree. Each version i (0-based) corresponds to the first i+1 elements (since we start from version 0). Wait, maybe versions are 1-based. Need to check.\n\nWait, the PST is built by inserting each element one by one. So for each position i (from 0 to n-1), we create a new version by updating the count for the compressed value of nums[i].\n\nThen, for a query (l, r, k), we need the versions r and l-1. Because the version r includes elements up to index r (assuming 0-based), and version l-1 includes up to l-1. So the difference gives the count in [l, r].\n\nWait, the problem states the query is (l, r, k), which is nums[l..r]. So if the array is 0-based, then the segment from l to r inclusive. So the versions would be: version r+1 minus version l. Because version i has the first i elements (if we start versions at 1). Hmm, need to be precise.\n\nLet me think: suppose the original array is nums[0..n-1]. We build the PST such that version i (for i from 0 to n) represents the state after processing the first i elements. So version 0 is empty. Version 1 has nums[0], version 2 has nums[0..1], etc.\n\nThen, to query the subarray from l to r (0-based), we need version r+1 minus version l. Because version r+1 has elements up to index r, and version l has up to index l-1. So the difference is elements from l to r.\n\nWait, for example, if l=0 and r=0 (the first element), then version 1 (r+1=1) minus version 0 (l=0) gives the count for the first element. Yes.\n\nSo the query function would take two roots: root_r = roots[r+1], root_l = roots[l], and then compute the difference.\n\nNow, building the PST. Each node in the segment tree covers a range of values (the compressed indices). The tree is built over the range [0, size-1], where size is the number of unique values.\n\nEach update (adding a new element) increments the count in the corresponding leaf and propagates up.\n\nThe PST is built by creating new nodes along the path of the update, so each version is a modified path from the root.\n\nNow, for the k-th smallest element: during the query, we start at the roots of version r+1 and version l. The count in the left subtree for the current range is (left_count_r - left_count_l). If this count is >=k, then the k-th element is in the left subtree. Otherwise, we go to the right subtree with k = k - (left_count_r - left_count_l).\n\nSo the algorithm for the query is similar to a regular segment tree query, but comparing the differences between the two versions.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, steps:\n\n1.

Create a boolean list (or array) of size n+1, initialized to True. The indices represent numbers from 0 to n.\n2. Mark 0 and 1 as False since they're not primes.\n3. Start with the first prime number, 2. Mark all multiples of 2 as non-prime.\n4. Move to the next unmarked number (which is a prime) and repeat the process until you've processed up to sqrt(n).\n5. Count the number of True values in the list, which correspond to primes.\n\nWait, but for efficiency, once you reach a prime p, you can start marking from p*p because smaller multiples would have been marked by previous primes. Also, the loop for primes only needs to go up to sqrt(n) since any composite number up to n must have a factor less than or equal to sqrt(n).\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nInitialize a list called is_prime of length n+1, all True.

Wait, but 2 is a prime. Wait, in this case, the sieve would correctly have is_prime[2] as True.\n\nWait, the loop for i should go up to sqrt(n), but if n is 2, sqrt(n) is ~1.414, so the loop doesn't run. So the sieve remains with 2 as prime, which is correct.\n\nSo the loop for i starts at 2, and goes up to int(sqrt(n)) inclusive.\n\nWait, in Python, the range for i would be from 2 to int(n**0.5) + 1.\n\nBecause for example, if n is 25, sqrt(25) is 5, so the range should include 5.\n\nSo the code would be for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) +1):\n\nBut wait, if n is 10, sqrt(10) is ~3.16, so int(n**0.5) is 3.

Continue this process up to sqrt(n), because any composite number larger than sqrt(n) would have a factor less than or equal to sqrt(n).\n\nWait, but for the sieve, you only need to check up to the square root of n. So the loop for the sieve should run from 2 to int(sqrt(n)) + 1.\n\nWait, let's see. For example, if n is 10, sqrt(10) is about 3.16. So the loop runs up to 3. Then 5 and 7 would be primes. So yes, the outer loop for the sieve runs up to sqrt(n).\n\nSo the algorithm steps in code:\n\n- Handle edge cases: if n < 2, return 0 since there are no primes less than 2.\n- Create a list is_prime where indices 0 and 1 are False, others True.\n- Iterate i from 2 to sqrt(n). For each i, if it's still marked as prime, mark all multiples starting from i*i as non-prime (since smaller multiples would have been marked by previous primes).\n- After processing, count the number of True values in is_prime.\n\nWait, but when marking multiples, starting from i*i is correct because 2i would have been marked when i was 2, but if i is 3, then 6 is already marked by 2, so starting at 9 is better.\n\nYes, so for each prime i, start marking from i*i.\n\nLet me outline the code:\n\ndef count_primes_upto(n: int) -> int:\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            # Mark multiples of i starting from i*i\n            for j in range(i*i, n + 1, i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n    return sum(is_prime)\n\nWait, but let's test this with a small n.

Let me think about how the Sieve works.\n\nFirst, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm for finding all primes up to a certain number. The basic idea is to create a list of all numbers from 2 up to n, then iteratively mark the multiples of each prime starting from 2. The numbers that remain unmarked are primes.\n\nWait, but the problem says count_primes_upto, so we just need the count, not the actual primes. So maybe we can optimize a bit by using a boolean array where True means prime, and then count the Trues.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. If n is less than 2, there are no primes, so return 0.\n2. Create a list (or array) of size n+1, initialized to True. Index 0 and 1 should be False since 0 and 1 are not primes.\n3. Start from 2. For each number i from 2 to sqrt(n), if it's still marked as prime, mark all its multiples as non-prime.\n4. After processing, count how many True values are left in the array from 2 to n.\n\nWait, but in Python, lists are 0-based. So for n=10, we need to check up to index 10.\n\nWait, for example, n=10. The primes are 2,3,5,7. So count is 4.\n\nLet me test the steps.\n\nInitialize a list of size 11 (0-10). Set is_prime[0] = False, is_prime[1] = False. All others True.\n\nThen start with i=2. Mark multiples of 2 (4,6,8,10) as False.\n\nNext i=3. Check if is_prime[3] is True. Yes. Mark multiples 6,9 as False.\n\ni=4: already marked as False, skip.\n\ni=5: sqrt(10) is ~3.16, so we stop when i exceeds sqrt(n). Wait, the loop should run up to sqrt(n), because any composite number has a factor <= sqrt(n).\n\nSo the loop for i in 2 to int(sqrt(n)) +1.\n\nWait, the standard sieve loops i from 2 to sqrt(n), inclusive. So for n=10, sqrt(n) is ~3.16, so i goes up to 3.\n\nThen, after that, all remaining True values from 2 to n are primes.\n\nSo the steps are correct.\n\nNow, translating this into code.\n\nFirst, handle edge cases where n < 2.

For each i, if is_prime[i] is True, then for j from i*i to n, step i, mark is_prime[j] as False.\n\nWait, starting from i*i because smaller multiples would have been marked by smaller primes.

But since 0 and 1 are set to False, it's correct.\n\nWait, for example, n=10, sum would be 4 (indices 2,3,5,7), which is correct.\n\nLet me test with n=2. The primes up to 2 is 1. So the function should return 1.\n\nIn the code: n=2. is_prime is [F, F, T]. Then sqrt(2) is 1, so the loop from 2 to 1+1=2. So i=2. Wait, sqrt(2) is approx 1.414, so int(math.isqrt(2)) is 1.

So for example, a subarray of length 4 (indices 0-3 when sorted), the median would be the element at index 1 (0-based), which is the second smallest. So in that case, the median is the (n//2)-th element for 0-based? Wait, let's clarify:\n\nIf the subarray has m elements, sorted, then the median is the element at position floor((m-1)/2). So for m odd: (m-1)/2 is integer, e.g., m=5 → 2nd index. For m even: m=4 → (3)/2=1.5 → floor is 1, so index 1.

Let's consider for each subarray that contains k, how many elements are less than k, equal to k, and greater than k.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this with a balance approach. Let's think of transforming the array into a new array where:\n\n- For elements less than k, assign -1.\n\n- For elements equal to k, assign 0.\n\n- For elements greater than k, assign +1.\n\nWait, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, since the median is k, in the sorted subarray, the number of elements less than k should be <= the number of elements greater than or equal to k, but perhaps more precise:\n\nLet m be the length of the subarray.\n\nThe median is at position t = (m-1)//2.\n\nSo in the sorted subarray, the element at t is k.\n\nThat means there are t elements before it (which are <=k), and (m-1 - t) elements after it (which are >=k).\n\nWait, but since the element at t is k, all elements before are <=k, and all after are >=k.\n\nBut to have the median exactly k, the element at t must be k.

But sometimes median definitions vary. For example, in some contexts, when the length is even, the median is the lower of the two middle numbers. Wait, but the problem statement probably specifies it. Wait, the problem says \"median equals k\". Hmm, maybe we need to check how the problem defines the median here.\n\nWait, the problem statement doesn't specify, but in programming problems like this, often the median for even-length subarrays is considered as the (n-1)/2-th element when sorted, which would be the lower median. Wait, no. Wait, for example, in some problems, when the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, but that's a float, which can't be equal to k (an integer). So perhaps the problem defines the median as the middle element when the subarray length is odd, and maybe the problem only considers subarrays of odd length. Wait, but the problem statement says \"count subarrays where median equals k\", so maybe they define the median as the (floor((n-1)/2)) element, which would be the lower median. Wait, but I need to check.\n\nWait, let's think. For example, if the subarray is [1,2,3], median is 2. If it's [1,2,3,4], then depending on definition, median could be 2 or 2.5. But since k is an integer, the median must be an integer. Therefore, the problem must be considering only subarrays where the median is an integer, which would happen when the subarray length is odd (since for even length, the median would be the average of two numbers, which may not be integer). Wait, but the problem says \"median equals k\", so perhaps the problem is considering the median as the middle element when sorted, regardless of even or odd. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the problem defines the median as the element at position floor((length-1)/2) when sorted. So for even length, like 4 elements, it's the 1st index (0-based), which is the second element. So for [1,2,3,4], the median would be 2. Then in that case, the median is always an element of the array, so it can be equal to k.\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let's see examples. Suppose k is 2. Then a subarray [1,2,3] has median 2. A subarray [2,3,4] has median 3. For a subarray of even length, say [1,2,3,4], sorted is [1,2,3,4], the median would be the element at position (4-1)/2 = 1.5 floored to 1, so index 1, which is 2. So the median is 2. So that subarray would count if k=2.\n\nWait, but in some definitions, the median for even n is the average of the two middle elements, but since that's not an integer here, the problem must be using the definition where the median is the element at position floor((n-1)/2) in the sorted subarray. So for any subarray, the median is the element at position m = (length - 1) // 2. So for length 1: m=0, median is the element. For length 2: m=0, median is first element when sorted. For length 3: m=1, second element. Etc.\n\nSo, given that, the problem is to count all subarrays where, when sorted, the element at position (len-1)//2 is equal to k.\n\nHmm.

But the problem states that the median equals k, so maybe they define the median as the middle element when the subarray length is odd, and perhaps for even-length subarrays, it's the lower or upper one.

Wait, the problem says \"subarrays where median equals k\". Let me check some examples.\n\nWait, maybe the problem defines the median as follows: for a subarray of length m, the median is the element at position (m-1)//2 when sorted. So for m=1: index 0, m=2: index 0 (since (2-1)//2=0), m=3: index 1, m=4: index 1 (since (4-1)//2=1.5 floored to 1), etc. Wait, but that would mean for even m, the median is the lower of the two middle elements. Alternatively, maybe the problem defines the median as the element at position m//2 when sorted. For example, m=1: 0, m=2: 1, m=3: 1, m=4: 2. Wait, but then for m=2, the median is the second element (0-based index 1), which is the higher one. Hmm, this is critical because it affects how we count.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's definition is that the median is the middle element when the subarray is sorted, and if the length is even, the median is the smaller of the two middle elements. Or maybe the problem is from a specific source where the median is defined as the (m+1)//2-th element, which for m even would be the upper median. Wait, but this is unclear. However, in many programming problems, when the problem refers to the median of a subarray as an element (not the average), they usually take the (m-1)//2-th index. For example, LeetCode problem 2488 has a similar definition where the median is the element at position (length-1)//2 when sorted. Let me check that problem. In LeetCode 2488, the median is defined as the middle element in the sorted subarray, and for even length, it's the lower middle element. So for a subarray of length m, the median is the element at index (m-1)//2 in the sorted array. So for m=3: index 1, m=4: index 1 (since (4-1)//2=1.5 floored to 1).

Wait, but some definitions take the average of the two middle numbers for even length, but since k is an integer here, the average would only be k if both are k, but that's probably not the case. So the problem must be considering the lower median, i.e., the element at position (m-1)//2 when the subarray is sorted.\n\nSo for example, if the subarray is [1,3,2], sorted it's [1,2,3], median is 2.

So in the subarray, there must be at least t elements <=k, where t is (m+1)//2 (since the median is the t-th smallest element). Wait, for m elements, sorted as a_0 <= a_1 <= ... <= a_{m-1}, the median is a_{(m-1)//2}. So for this to equal k, a_{(m-1)//2} =k. That means that in the subarray, there are at least (m+1)//2 elements that are <=k (since the median is k, so all elements up to the median are <=k), and at least (m+1)//2 elements that are >=k (since the median is k, elements from the median onwards are >=k).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way: Let's consider for each subarray that contains k, how to check if k is the median.\n\nFirst, the subarray must contain k.

Since it's a circular clock, the time wraps around after 24 hours, so the minimum difference could be the shorter way around the clock.\n\nFirst, I should convert all the times into minutes since midnight. That makes it easier to compute differences. For example, \"01:30\" becomes 90 minutes.\n\nOnce converted, I can sort the list of minutes. Sorting helps because the minimum difference is likely between consecutive times, but since it's circular, the last and first elements also need to be checked (like 23:59 and 00:01 would have a 2-minute difference).\n\nWait, but after sorting, the list is in ascending order. So the possible candidates for minimum difference are between each adjacent pair in the sorted list, and also between the last element and the first element (plus 1440 minutes for the circular wrap-around).\n\nLet me think. For example, if the sorted times in minutes are [t0, t1, ..., tn-1], then the differences are t1 - t0, t2 - t1, ..., tn-1 - tn-2, and (t0 + 1440) - tn-1.

Find the minimum difference.\n\nWait, but the circular difference is 1440 - (last - first) if we take the wrap-around. Wait, no. Let's see: the time difference between the last time (say 1439 minutes, which is 23:59) and the first time (1 minute, 00:01) is 2 minutes (since 1439 to 1440 is 1 minute, then 0 to 1 is another minute, total 2). But in minutes, the circular difference would be (1 + 1440) - 1439 = 2. So yes, the formula is (first + 1440) - last.\n\nSo for the circular case, the difference is (sorted[0] + 1440) - sorted[-1].\n\nBut wait, after sorting, the list is in order, so the regular consecutive differences are sorted[i] - sorted[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1. Then the circular difference is sorted[0] + 1440 - sorted[-1].\n\nWait, but the minimum difference could be either the smallest consecutive difference or the circular one. So all these need to be considered.\n\nFor example, if all times are spread out, the circular difference might be the smallest.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Convert all times to minutes.\n- Sort the list.\n- Compute min( (sorted[i] - sorted[i-1]) for all i from 1 to n-1, and (sorted[0] + 1440 - sorted[-1]) )\n\nWait, but the circular difference is 1440 - (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]) if sorted[-1] > sorted[0], but since it's sorted, sorted[-1] >= sorted[0]. So the circular difference is 1440 - (sorted[-1] - sorted[0])? Wait no, because the actual time difference between sorted[-1] and sorted[0] on a circular clock is min( sorted[0] + 1440 - sorted[-1], sorted[-1] - sorted[0] ). But since the list is sorted, sorted[-1] >= sorted[0], so sorted[-1] - sorted[0] is the direct difference, but the circular one would be 1440 - (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]) if that's smaller. Wait, no. Wait, the minimum time difference between two times on a 24-hour clock is the minimum of |a - b| and 1440 - |a - b|.\n\nBut since we have sorted the list, for consecutive elements, the difference is positive and less than 1440 (assuming no duplicates). Wait, but if two times are the same, the difference is 0.\n\nSo for each adjacent pair in the sorted list, the difference is sorted[i] - sorted[i-1], which is the direct difference. The circular difference between the last and first is (sorted[0] + 1440) - sorted[-1], which is the same as 1440 - (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]).\n\nSo the minimum difference is the smallest among all consecutive differences (including the circular one).\n\nWait, but for the consecutive elements in the sorted list, the difference is the minimal possible for those two times, because if the direct difference is larger than 720, the circular difference would be smaller, but since the list is sorted, the direct difference between consecutive elements shou", "length_tokens": 1944}

I need to find the minimum time difference in minutes between any two times in a list, considering a circular clock. So, the clock is 24-hour, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says \"circular clock,\" but typically time differences on a 24-hour clock would be circular. Wait, but maybe it's a 12-hour clock? Hmm, the problem statement says \"minimum minutes difference on circular clock (variant name)\". Wait, the example times are probably given in HH:MM format. Let me think.\n\nWait, the input is a list of strings like [\"23:59\", \"00:00\"]. So, these are 24-hour times. Because 23:59 is valid in 24-hour. So the clock is 24 hours, which is 1440 minutes (24*60). So the circular aspect is that the time wraps around after 24 hours. So the maximum possible difference between two times is 720 minutes (12 hours), because beyond that, it's shorter the other way.\n\nSo the problem is: given a list of times in \"HH:MM\" format, find the smallest difference between any two times, considering that the clock is circular (so the difference between 23:59 and 00:00 is 1 minute, not 1439).\n\nFirst step: convert each time string into total minutes since midnight. For example, \"01:30\" becomes 90 minutes.\n\nThen, sort the list of minutes. Once sorted, the minimal difference is either between consecutive elements, or between the last and first (because of the circular nature).\n\nWait, but in a circular list, the minimal difference could be between the last element and the first element plus 1440 (since the total minutes in a day is 1440). Wait, let's think.\n\nSuppose we have sorted times in minutes: [t0, t1, ..., tn-1], sorted in ascending order.\n\nThe possible minimal differences are:\n\n- For each i from 0 to n-2, t_{i+1} - t_i.\n\n- Also, (t0 + 1440) - t_{n-1}, which is the wrap-around difference.\n\nBecause the clock is circular, the difference between the last time and the first time is min(t0 + 1440 - t_{n-1}, t_{n-1} - t0), but since the list is sorted, t_{n-1} >= t0, so t_{n-1} - t0 would be the direct difference, but the wrap-around is 1440 - (t_{n-1} - t0). Wait, no. Wait, the total circle is 1440 minutes, so the minimal difference between two times a and b is min(|a - b|, 1440 - |a - b|). But when sorted, for consecutive elements in the sorted list (including the wrap-around), the minimal difference would be the smallest of (next - current) for all adjacent pairs (including last and first +1440).\n\nWait, for example, if sorted times are [100, 200, 1300]. Then the differences are 100 (200-100), 1100 (1300-200), and (100 +1440 -1300)=240. So the minimal is 100. But the actual minimal difference between 1300 and 100 is min(1200, 240) which is 240, but in the sorted list, the consecutive differences (including wrap-around) would capture the minimal possible.\n\nWait, but when the list is sorted, the minimal non-wrap difference is between consecutive elements, and the wrap-around difference is between the last and first. So the minimal of all those is the answer.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n1. Convert all times to minutes.\n\n2. Sort the list.\n\n3. Compute the differences between consecutive elements (including the wrap-around difference between last and first +1440).\n\n4. The minimal difference is the smallest among these.\n\nWait, but for the wrap-around, it's (first element + 1440) - last element.\n\nBecause the sorted list is in order, so the last element is the largest. The difference between first and last in the sorted list is last - first. The wrap-around difference is 1440 - (last - first), but since the clock is circular, the minimal difference between first and last is min(last - first, 1440 - (last - first)), but in the sorted list, the consecutive elements after sorting will have the minimal non-wrap differences. However, the wrap-around difference (first +1440 - last) is the actual minimal possible for that pair.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose times are [\"23:59\", \"00:00\"].

I need to find the minimum time difference in minutes between any two times in a list, considering a circular clock. So, since it's a circular clock, the time wraps around at 24:00, which is the same as 00:00. The minimum difference could be the smaller of the two possible differences between two times (the forward and backward on the circle).\n\nFirst, I need to convert each time string into minutes since midnight. For example, \"01:30\" becomes 90 minutes. Then, sort all these minute values. Once sorted, the minimum difference is usually between consecutive times. But because it's circular, the difference between the last and first time (wrapping around) also needs to be considered.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the circular part? Let's think. Suppose we have times sorted in ascending order. The differences between consecutive elements are checked, but also the difference between the first time plus 24*60 (1440 minutes) and the last time. Because the clock is circular, the time after 23:59 is 00:00.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Convert each time string to minutes. Split each string by colon, convert hours to minutes and add the minutes part.\n\n2. Sort the list of minutes.\n\n3. Compute the differences between consecutive elements. The minimum difference here is a candidate.\n\n4. Also compute the difference between the first element + 1440 and the last element. Because the circular difference would be (first + 1440) - last, which is equivalent to 1440 - (last - first), but maybe not. Wait, for example, if the last time is 23:00 (1380 minutes) and the first is 01:00 (60), then the circular difference is 60 + (1440 - 1380) = 60 + 60 = 120 minutes. Wait, no. Wait, 23:00 to 01:00 is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. How to calculate that? The total minutes in a day is 1440. So the difference between 1380 (23:00) and 60 (01:00) is min( |60 - 1380|, 1440 - |60 -1380| ). But 1380 -60 is 1320, so the other way is 1440 -1320 = 120. So the minimum is 120.\n\nBut when the list is sorted, the last element is 1380, first is 60. So the circular difference would be (60 + 1440) - 1380 = 1500 -1380 = 120. So yes, that's correct. So the circular difference is (first + 1440) - last.\n\nSo after sorting, the minimum difference is the minimum between the smallest consecutive difference and (first + 1440 - last).\n\nWait, but when there are only two times, for example, 23:00 and 01:00. Then sorted list is [60, 1380]. The consecutive difference is 1320, and the circular is 120, which is the minimum.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- Convert all times to minutes.\n\n- Sort the list.\n\n- Compute min_diff as the minimum between (list[i+1] - list[i] for all i) and (list[0] + 1440 - list[-1]).\n\nBut wait, when there are multiple times, the minimal difference could be between any two consecutive times in the sorted list, or the wrap-around between last and first.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Convert to minutes.\n\n2. Sort.\n\n3. Compute the minimal consecutive difference.\n\n4. Compute the circular difference (first + 1440 - last).\n\n5. The answer is the minimum between the minimal consecutive difference and the circular difference.\n\nWait, but for example, if the list is [0, 60, 120], sorted. The consecutive differences are 60, 60. The circular difference is 0 +1440 -120=1320. So the minimum is 60.\n\nAnother example: times are [\"23:59\", \"00:00\", \"12:00\"]. Converted to [1439, 0, 720]. Sorted becomes [0, 720, 1439].\n\nConsecutive differences: 720-0=720, 1439-720=719. The circular difference is 0 +1440 -1439 =1.

Converted to [300, 600, 900]. Sorted. Consecutive differences 300 each. Circular difference is 300 +1440 -900 = 840. So the minimum is 300.\n\nWait, but the circular difference here is 1440 - (900 -300) = 1440-600=840, which is larger than 300, so the minimal is 300.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, edge cas", "length_tokens": 1729}

The output should be a tuple with sig_valid: bool, which is True if the verification works.\n\nFirst, I remember ECDSA steps. The signing process involves generating a nonce k, computing the point (x, y) = k*G, then r = x mod n. If r is 0, we need to pick another k, but according to the problem statement, k is deterministic: hash(msg) % n + 1. Wait, the hash is defined as msg % 1_000_003. So k = (msg % 1_000_003) % n + 1. Wait, the problem says k = hash(msg) % n + 1, and the hash is msg % 1_000_003. So first compute hash = msg % 1000003, then k = (hash % n) + 1. But wait, maybe it's hash(msg) = msg % 1000003, then k = (hash) % n + 1. Wait, the problem says \"deterministic nonce k=hash(msg)%n+1 (use simple hash: msg%1_000_003)\".

So k is computed as (msg % 1000003) % n, then add 1. Wait, but if (msg % 1000003) % n is 0, then k would be 1. But k must be in [1, n-1]. Wait, the problem says k = hash(msg) % n + 1. Wait, that would be (hash(msg) % n) + 1. But if hash(msg) % n is n-1, then k would be n, which is invalid because k must be less than n. Hmm, but the problem statement says \"k=hash(msg)%n+1\". Wait, maybe it's (hash(msg) + 1) % n, but the problem says \"hash(msg)%n + 1\". So for example, if hash(msg) is 5 and n is 10, then 5%10=5, +1=6. But if hash is 9, then 9%10=9, +1=10, which equals n. But k must be in [1, n-1]. So this could be a problem. Wait, but the problem says \"k=hash(msg)%n +1\", so maybe the problem assumes that hash(msg) %n is in [0, n-1], so adding 1 would make it [1, n]. But k must be less than n, so if it's n, then it's invalid. However, the problem says to use this k, so perhaps we have to check if k is 0 or >=n and adjust. Wait, but the problem statement says \"k=hash(msg)%n +1\". So perhaps the problem expects us to use that formula, and if k >=n, then maybe it's invalid. But the problem says \"deterministic nonce k=hash(msg)%n+1\", so maybe we have to use it as is, even if k is out of range. But ECDSA requires k to be in [1, n-1]. So perhaps the problem expects that the hash function's output mod n is in [0, n-1], then adding 1 gives [1, n]. So if k equals n, then it's invalid. But in practice, ECDSA would require choosing another k, but the problem says to use this deterministic k. So maybe the problem assumes that k is valid (i.e., k < n), but the problem doesn't specify handling that. Wait, the problem says \"k=hash(msg)%n +1\", so perhaps we have to compute k as (hash % n) +1, but if that's >=n, then maybe it's invalid. However, the problem says \"Return True if verify works.\" So perhaps during signing, if k is invalid (e.g., k >=n), the signature would be invalid, so the verification would fail. But the problem is to implement the sign and verify steps as per the given k.\n\nSo steps for signing:\n\n1. Compute k = (msg % 1000003) % n + 1. Wait, but (msg % 1000003) is the hash, then k = (hash) % n + 1. Wait, no: the problem says \"k=hash(msg)%n +1\", and hash(msg) is msg%1_000_003. So k = (msg % 1000003) % n + 1? Or is it (msg % 1000003) % (n) +1? Let's parse the problem statement: \"k=hash(msg)%n+1 (use simple hash: msg%1_000_003)\". So hash(msg) is msg%1000003, then k = (hash(msg)) % n + 1. Wait, no: hash(msg) % n +1. So hash is computed as msg%1000003, then take that value mod n, then add 1. So k = ( (msg % 1000003) % n ) + 1.\n\nWait, but modulo n of a number that's already mod n is redundant. So (msg % 1000003) could be larger than n, so taking mod n again.

Let me think. The problem is to find the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll, which means one envelope can fit into another only if both width and height are strictly larger.\n\nFirst, I remember that this is similar to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem, but with two dimensions. The standard approach is to sort the envelopes in a way that allows us to apply LIS on one dimension.\n\nWait, right. The trick here is to sort the envelopes by width in ascending order, and if two envelopes have the same width, sort their heights in descending order. Why descending? Because if we have the same width, we can't nest them (since width isn't strictly increasing), so by sorting heights in descending order, we prevent including multiple envelopes with the same width in the LIS, which would be invalid.\n\nOnce sorted, the problem reduces to finding the longest increasing subsequence based on height. Because after sorting by width, for any two envelopes where the width is increasing (and strictly when widths are different), we just need the heights to form an increasing sequence.\n\nWait, but when widths are the same, the heights are sorted in reverse, so when we process the heights, the LIS algorithm won't pick more than one from the same width group. For example, if two envelopes have the same width, their heights are ordered from high to low, so when looking for increasing heights, the next one can't be part of the same sequence.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Sort envelopes by width (ascending), and if same width, sort height descending.\n\n2. Extract the list of heights.\n\n3. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the height list.\n\nBut wait, how to compute LIS efficiently? The standard O(n^2) approach is too slow for large n, but there's an O(n log n) method using binary search.\n\nThe O(n log n) approach for LIS works by maintaining a list where each element is the smallest possible tail value for all increasing subsequences of a given length.\n\nSo for each height in the sorted list, we do:\n\n- If it's larger than the last element in the tails list, append it.\n\n- Else, find the first element in tails that is >= current height, and replace it with the current height.\n\nThis way, tails remains sorted, and the length of tails gives the LIS length.\n\nLet me test this with an example.\n\nExample: envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]\n\nSort them: first by width ascending. So sorted order would be [2,3], [5,4], [6,7], [6,4]. Wait, because for same width (6), height is sorted descending, so 7 comes before 4.\n\nHeights list: [3,4,7,4]\n\nNow find LIS of [3,4,7,4].\n\nProcessing:\n\n- 3: tails = [3]\n\n- 4: >3, append → [3,4]\n\n-7: append → [3,4,7]\n\n-4: find first >=4 in tails, which is 4 (at index 1), replace with 4. tails becomes [3,4,7] → no change. Wait, but 4 is equal to the current element. Wait, the tails list is [3,4,7]. The current element is 4. We need to find the first element >=4. That's 4. So replace it with 4. So tails becomes [3,4,7] → same as before. So the length remains 3.\n\nSo the maximum is 3. Which is correct: [2,3] → [5,4] → [6,7].\n\nAnother example: [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3]]. After sorting, widths are same, so heights sorted descending: [3,2,1]. LIS of heights is length 1, which is correct because all have same width.\n\nAnother example: [[2,3],[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[1,2]]. Wait, sorted by width: [1,2], [2,3], [5,4], [6,7], [6,4]. Heights: 2,3,4,7,4. LIS is 2,3,4,7 → length 4? Wait, but [1,2] → [2,3] → [5,4] → [6,7]. But 4 <7, but 5,4 to 6,7 is okay. Wait, the heights after sorting are [2,3,4,7,4]. The LIS would be 2,3,4,7 → length 4. So the answer is 4.\n\nWait, but the envelope [5,4] has height 4, which is less than 7. So that sequence is valid.\n\nYes. So the algorithm works.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort envelopes: key is (width, -height)\n\n- Extract heights\n\n- Compute LIS of the heights array using the O(n log n) method.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, sort the envelopes.\n\nenvelopes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n\nThen, extract the height", "length_tokens": 1764}

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem is: given a list of envelopes with (width, height), find the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested inside each other. An envelope can fit into another if both width and height are strictly larger.\n\nHmm, this reminds me of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. Because for nesting, each subsequent envelope must be larger in both dimensions. So if I can sort the envelopes in a way that allows me to apply LIS on one dimension, maybe.\n\nWait, right. The standard approach here is to sort the envelopes first. But how exactly?\n\nLet me recall. If we sort by width in ascending order, and if widths are equal, sort height in descending order. Why descending? Because if two envelopes have the same width, you can't nest them, so by sorting height descending, when we process the heights, those with same width won't form an increasing sequence, which prevents invalid nesting.\n\nFor example, if we have envelopes (2,3) and (2,4), after sorting, (2,4) comes before (2,3). Then when we take the heights array [4,3], the LIS of this would not include both, which is correct.\n\nOnce sorted, the problem reduces to finding the longest increasing subsequence on the heights. Because the widths are already sorted, so as long as the heights are increasing, the widths will also be non-decreasing (but since same widths are handled by the height sort), the actual valid sequences will have strictly increasing widths (because when widths are same, heights are decreasing, so they can't be part of the same LIS).\n\nWait, let me verify. Suppose after sorting, the widths are in order, so for two envelopes i and j where i < j, either width[i] < width[j], or width[i] == width[j] and height[i] >= height[j].\n\nSo when we take the height array, any increasing subsequence in heights will correspond to a sequence where each subsequent envelope has a larger width (since if width is same, the heights are in descending order, so you can't have two same widths in the LIS). Therefore, the LIS on the heights will give the correct maximum nesting.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort envelopes by width ascending, and if same width, height descending.\n\n2. Extract the heights into a list.\n\n3. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the heights list.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow, the LIS problem can be solved in O(n^2) with dynamic programming, but for larger n, we need O(n log n) using patience sorting.\n\nGiven that the problem might have a large number of envelopes (though the problem statement doesn't specify constraints), but as an engineer, I should implement the efficient version.\n\nWait, the problem says \"max_envelopes(envelopes:list[tuple[int,int]])->int\".

The key is lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]).\n\nThen, create a list of heights.\n\nThen compute LIS of that list.\n\nSo, for example, if envelopes are [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]], after sorting:\n\nsorted_envelopes = sorted(envelopes, key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n\nWhich would be [(2,3), (5,4), (6,7), (6,4)].\n\nHeights list is [3,4,7,4].\n\nThe LIS of [3,4,7,4] is [3,4,7] length 3, which is correct (the answer is 3).\n\nAnother example: if all widths are same, then after sorting, heights are in descending order, so LIS is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems valid.\n\nNow, implementing the LIS part with O(n log n).\n\nThe standard method is to maintain a list that represents the smallest possible tail for all increasing subsequences of length i+1.\n\nFor each number in the array:\n\n- If it's larger than the last element in the list, append it.\n\n- Else, find the first element in the list that is >= current number, and replace it with current number.\n\nAt the end, the length of the list is the length of the LIS.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef length_of_lis(nums):\n    tails = []\n    for num in nums:\n        # Find the position where num should be inserted\n        left, right = 0, len(tails)\n        while l", "length_tokens": 1982}

Let me think about it. The problem is to find the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll, which means one envelope can fit into another only if both width and height are strictly larger.\n\nSo, given a list of envelopes with (width, height), I need to find the longest increasing subsequence where both dimensions are strictly increasing.\n\nHmm, I remember that this is similar to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem but with two dimensions. The standard approach for LIS is O(n^2) with dynamic programming, but for large n, that's not efficient. However, for this problem, there's a better approach.\n\nWait, the key idea here is to sort the envelopes first. How to sort them? If we sort by width in ascending order, and for the same width, sort height in descending order. Why descending? Because if two envelopes have the same width, you can't put one inside the other, so sorting height descending ensures that when we process the heights, the same width envelopes don't get counted in the LIS. Because if they were sorted ascending, the LIS might include multiple same-width envelopes, which is invalid.\n\nOnce sorted, the problem reduces to finding the LIS of the heights array. Because after sorting by width (and handling same widths correctly), the problem becomes finding the longest sequence where heights are strictly increasing. Because the widths are already sorted, so as long as the heights are increasing, the widths will be non-decreasing. But since same widths are sorted by height descending, any increasing sequence in heights will have strictly increasing widths (since same width ones have higher heights first, so they can't be part of the same sequence).\n\nWait, let me verify. Suppose we have envelopes sorted by width ascending, and for same width, height descending. So for example, if there's (2,3), (2,4), they would be sorted as (2,4), (2,3). Then, when we look at the heights array, it's [4,3]. The LIS here would be length 1, which is correct because you can't put (2,4) inside (2,3).\n\nSo by sorting same width heights in descending order, we ensure that only one envelope per width is considered in the LIS for heights.\n\nOnce sorted, the problem reduces to finding the LIS of the height array, but with the condition that it's strictly increasing. Because for the heights, we need each next height to be larger than the previous. Wait, but in the standard LIS problem, sometimes it's non-decreasing, but here it's strictly increasing.\n\nWait, the standard patience sorting algorithm for LIS finds the longest non-decreasing subsequence. But here, we need strictly increasing. So maybe we need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, in our case, after sorting the envelopes by width ascending and height descending, the heights array will have for same width, higher heights first. Then, when we process the heights, any valid sequence must have strictly increasing heights, which would correspond to strictly increasing widths (since widths are sorted ascending, but same widths are handled by the height sort).\n\nSo the problem becomes, given the heights array (after sorting), find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.\n\nWait, but how does the patience sorting work for strictly increasing? Let's think.\n\nThe standard algorithm for LIS (longest non-decreasing) uses a greedy approach where for each element, you find the first element in the 'tails' array that is >= current, and replace it. But for strictly increasing, we need the next element to be greater than the previous.\n\nWait, in our case, since the widths are sorted, and for same widths, heights are sorted descending, the heights array will have the property that if two elements have the same width, their heights are in descending order. So when we process the heights, any two elements with the same width cannot be part of the same increasing subsequence. Because their heights are in descending order, so you can't have both in the sequence.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the longest strictly increasing sub", "length_tokens": 2288}

Let me think.\n\nThe problem is to find the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested inside each other. Each envelope is a tuple of (width, height), and one envelope can fit into another only if both width and height are strictly larger.\n\nHmm, I remember that this is similar to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. But since there are two dimensions, I need to sort them in a way that reduces it to a 1D problem.\n\nWait, right. The standard approach is to sort the envelopes by width in ascending order. But if two envelopes have the same width, how to handle them? Because you can't nest envelopes with the same width. So, for the same width, we should sort the heights in descending order. Why? Because if two have the same width, the one with larger height can't contain the smaller one, so by sorting heights descending, when we process the heights, we avoid including multiple envelopes with the same width in the LIS.\n\nFor example, if we have envelopes like (2,3), (2,4), if sorted by width ascending and height ascending, then the heights would be 3,4, which would form an increasing sequence, but since widths are same, they can't be nested. So by sorting heights descending, the heights would be 4,3, so the LIS in heights would not include both.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Sort envelopes: first by width ascending, then by height descending.\n\n2. Then find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) on the heights array. Because after sorting, the widths are non-decreasing, but since same widths are handled by height descending, the LIS in heights will ensure that both width and height are strictly increasing.\n\nWait, let's check. Suppose after sorting, the widths are in order, so for two envelopes i and j where i < j, width[i] <= width[j]. If width[i] < width[j], then for the height, if height[i] < height[j], then j can contain i. If width[i] == width[j], then since we sorted heights descending, height[i] >= height[j], so height[i] < height[j] is impossible. So in the sorted list, the only possible valid pairs for nesting are when i < j, width[i] < width[j], and height[i] < height[j]. Therefore, by taking the heights array after this sort, finding the LIS on heights will give the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested, because the widths are already non-decreasing, and the LIS ensures that each subsequent height is larger, which implies that the width must also be larger (since if width was equal, the height would be smaller or equal, so not part of the increasing sequence).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the LIS of the heights array after the correct sorting.\n\nNow, how to compute the LIS efficiently. The standard O(n^2) DP approach would be too slow for large n (like 1e4 elements), but the problem might expect the O(n log n) approach.\n\nThe O(n log n) method for LIS involves building a list where each element represents the smallest possible tail value for all increasing subsequences of a certain length. For each element in the array, we use binary search to find the position where this element can replace the current tail to potentially form a longer subsequence.\n\nSo the steps for the algorithm:\n\n- Sort the envelopes as (width ascending, height descending).\n- Extract the heights into a list.\n- Compute the LIS length of this heights list using the O(n log n) method.\n\nLet's test with an example.\n\nExample: envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]\n\nAfter sorting:\n\nFirst, sort by width: 2,5,6,6.\n\nFor width 6, sort heights descending: 7,4.\n\nSo sorted envelopes: (2,3), (5,4), (6,7), (6,4).\n\nHeights array: [3,4,7,4]\n\nNow find LIS of [3,4,7,4].\n\nThe LIS here is 3,4,7 (length 3), but wait, the correct maximum nesting is 3: (2,3) -> (5,4) -> (6,7).

Since the left nodes are 0..U-1 and right 0..V-1, we can create an adjacency list for the left nodes. So for each left node u, list all v such that (u, v) is in edges.\n\nThe algorithm maintains:\n- matchL: array of size U, where matchL[u] is the matched right node for u, or -1 if none.\n- matchR: array of size V, where matchR[v] is the matched left node for v, or -1 if none.\n\nThe steps:\n\n1.

Then, for each layer, process nodes by alternating between left and right.\n   \n   Wait, the BFS in Hopcroft-Karp is a bit specific. It builds layers where even layers are left nodes and odd are right. The BFS starts from free left nodes (distance 0), then for each left node u in the queue, look at all neighbors v. If v is not matched, then we've found an augmenting path (but need to check if it's the shortest). Wait, no: the BFS is used to compute the shortest distance from free left nodes to free right nodes.\n\n   The BFS steps:\n\n   - dist: array for left nodes (size U), initialized to infinity (or -1).

Usually, we have matchL and matchR arrays where matchL[u] is the matched vertex in V for u in U, and similarly matchR[v] for v in V. Initially, all are set to -1 or None.\n\n2. While there are augmenting paths:\n   a. Use BFS starting from all free left nodes (those not in the current matching) to build a layered graph where each layer alternates between unmatched and matched edges.\n   b. Use DFS to find a maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest augmenting paths in this layered graph.\n   c. Augment the matching along these paths.\n\nThe key idea is that BFS builds the shortest augmenting paths, and DFS finds them in a way that avoids overlapping paths.\n\nLet me think about the data structures needed.\n\n- matchL: list of length U, matchL[u] = v if u is matched to v, else -1.\n- matchR: list of length V, matchR[v] = u if v is matched to u, else -1.\n\nFor BFS, we need to compute the distance (level) of each left node. The BFS starts from all free left nodes (those where matchL[u] is -1). The BFS alternates between unmatched edges (from U to V) and matched edges (from V to U).\n\nWait, the layered graph is built such that each layer alternates between unmatched and matched edges. So starting from free left nodes (layer 0), we go to their neighbors (via unmatched edges) to layer 1, then from those neighbors via matched edges (to the next layer), etc.\n\nIn the BFS, we assign distances (d) to each node in U. For nodes in V, maybe we track their distance as well, but perhaps it's handled implicitly.\n\nWait, the standard Hopcroft-Karp BFS:\n\n- Initialize a queue with all free left nodes (u where matchL[u] == -1), and set their distance to 0.\n- While queue not empty:\n   - Dequeue a left node u.\n   - For each neighbor v of u:\n      - If the edge (u, v) is not in the matching (but since we're building the layered graph for augmenting paths, maybe in the BFS we consider edges not in the matching from U to V, and edges in the matching from V to U), then we look at the next node.\n      - So for each v in adj[u], if the current matching for v is not set (but no, in the layered graph, from U to V we take unmatched edges. Wait, the augmenting path starts with an unmatched edge, then matched, etc.\n\nWait, in the BFS phase, we build a graph where edges from U to V are only those not in the current matching, and edges from V to U are only those in the current matching. Then the BFS is done on this directed graph.\n\nSo the BFS starts from all free U nodes (distance 0). Then, for each u in the queue, we look at all v adjacent to u via edges not in the matching (since the first edge of an augmenting path is unmatched). Then from v, we can go to the matched u' (if any), which is the node that v is currently matched to. So the BFS alternates between layers.\n\nThe BFS constructs layers where each layer k contains nodes at distance k from the start. The BFS stops when it reaches a free node in V (since that's the end of an augmenting path).\n\nWait, the BFS is used to find the shortest augmenting paths. The distance array (for left nodes) is used in the DFS to ensure that we only traverse edges that go to the next layer.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- BFS to compute distances (d) for left nodes. For right nodes, perhaps we don't need to store distances, but during BFS, when we go from u (left) to v (right) via an unm", "length_tokens": 2455}

After sorting, I can apply the LIS algorithm on the height dimension\n\nLet me trace through the example:\n- Envelopes: [(5,4),(6,4),(6,7),(2,3)]\n- After sorting by width ascending, height descending for ties: [(2,3),(5,4),(6,7),(6,4)]\n- Now find LIS on heights: [3,4,7,4] → LIS is [3,4,7] with length 3\n\nThe key insight is the sorting strategy and then applying LIS on the second

I need to find the minimal number of adjacent swaps required to group identical letters together in a string. And I have to choose the best letter to group, meaning the one that requires the least swaps.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. For example, if the string is \"abacab\", maybe grouping all 'a's together would take fewer swaps than grouping 'b's or 'c's.\n\nWait, the problem says \"choose the best letter\", so the answer is the minimum swaps needed for any letter. So for each distinct character in the string, calculate the minimal swaps required to group all instances of that character together, then take the smallest among those.\n\nNow, how to calculate the minimal adjacent swaps to group a particular character?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a character, say 'a', and in the string s, the positions of 'a's are at indices [i1, i2, ..., ik]. When we group them together, they should occupy consecutive positions. But where exactly? The minimal swaps would depend on the target positions.\n\nWait, but for adjacent swaps, the minimal number of swaps to bring all the 'a's together is equivalent to moving them to a consecutive block, and the optimal position for that block is around the median of their original positions. Because the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.\n\nWait, yes. For example, if we have positions [1,3,5], the median is 3. If we move them to positions 2,3,4, then each element's distance is |1-2| + |3-3| + |5-4| = 1+0+1=2. But if we move to 1,2,3, it's 0+1+2=3. So median is better.\n\nWait, the minimal total distance is achieved when the target positions are centered around the median. So for grouping, the optimal target positions for the k elements are from m - (k//2) to m + (k - k//2 -1), where m is the median. But maybe it's easier to model this as follows:\n\nFor a given character, collect all the indices where it occurs. Let's say there are m occurrences, so positions p0, p1, ..., p_{m-1} in sorted order.\n\nWhen grouped, they should be in consecutive positions. Let's say the leftmost position of the group is x. Then the target positions are x, x+1, ..., x + m -1.\n\nThe total number of swaps required is the sum of |pi - (x + i)| for i from 0 to m-1.\n\nWe need to find x that minimizes this sum.\n\nBut x has to be such that x + m -1 <= n-1 (where n is the length of the string). However, the minimal sum occurs when the target positions are as close as possible to the original positions. So the optimal x is such that the target block is centered around the median of the pi's.\n\nAlternatively, there's a known formula for this. For the minimal total distance, when moving points to consecutive positions, the minimal sum is achieved when the target block is placed such that the median of the original positions aligns with the median of the target block.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. For the positions p0 <= p1 <= ... <= p_{k-1}, the minimal total distance is sum_{i=0}^{k-1} |p_i - (m + i)|, where m is chosen such that the target positions are m, m+1, ..., m +k-1.\n\nWait, but how to find m?\n\nAlternatively, consider that when grouping the k elements, the relative order of the elements doesn't change (since we are only swapping adjacent elements, which doesn't change the order of identical elements). So the first occurrence of the character will end up at position x, the second at x+1, etc.\n\nThe minimal total distance is sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (p_i - (x + i)) if p_i >= x +i, but absolute value.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal x is p_{mid} - mid, where mid is the middle index. For example, if k is the number of elements, mid = k//2.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose positions are [0, 2, 3, 5], so k=4. The median positions would be between 2 and 3. The target block should be placed such that the middle of the block aligns with the median of the original positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal target positions are centered at the median of the original positions. Let's see.\n\nOriginal positions: [0,2,3,5]. The median is between 2 and 3. For k=4, the target block should be of length 4.

The problem is to find the minimal number of adjacent swaps needed to group identical letters together, and we can choose which letter to group. So the goal is to figure out for each letter in the string, what's the minimum swaps required to group all its occurrences together, and then pick the smallest among those.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how to calculate the swaps for a particular letter. Let's say we have a string like 'abacab'. Let's take 'a' which appears at positions 0, 2, 4. To group all 'a's together, we need to bring them next to each other. How do adjacent swaps work here?\n\nI remember that for grouping elements, the minimal swaps can be found by considering the median position. Wait, no, maybe it's about the target positions. For example, if we have k occurrences of a letter, the target positions would be a consecutive block. The optimal block is such that the sum of distances from each occurrence to the target block is minimized.\n\nWait, adjacent swaps are equivalent to the total distance each element has to move, but since swaps are adjacent, each swap moves an element by one. However, when moving multiple elements, their movements can interfere. But perhaps there's a way to model this as the sum of the differences between the original positions and the target positions, adjusted for the order.\n\nWait, another approach: for a given letter, collect all the indices where it occurs. Let's say the positions are [p0, p1, ..., pk-1] for k occurrences. To group them, we want to move them to a consecutive block. The minimal number of swaps would be the minimal total distance each element has to move to form that block.\n\nBut how to compute that? I think the optimal target positions for the letters are such that the middle element (median) stays in place, and others move towards it. Wait, for example, if we have positions [0, 2, 4], the target block could be positions 1,2,3. Wait, but how do we determine where the block should be placed?\n\nAlternatively, the target block for k elements should start at some position s, and occupy s, s+1, ..., s + k -1. We need to find s that minimizes the total distance each p_i has to move to their target positions.\n\nBut how to compute s? The target positions for the letters should be centered around the median of the original positions. Wait, maybe the minimal total distance is achieved when the target block is arranged such that the i-th element in the sorted positions moves to s + i.\n\nWait, let's think of the target positions as a sequence of consecutive integers. Let's say the target positions are t_0, t_1, ..., t_{k-1}, where t_i = m + i for some m. The sum of |p_i - t_i| for all i would give the total number of swaps needed, because each element has to move from p_i to t_i, and each adjacent swap moves it one step.\n\nBut how to choose m such that this sum is minimized?\n\nLet’s consider the example where the positions are [0, 2, 4]. Let's say k=3. The target positions should be three consecutive numbers. Let's suppose we choose the target to start at 1: positions 1,2,3. Then the first element (0) needs to move to 1 (1 swap), the second (2) stays (0), the third (4) moves to 3 (1 swap). Total swaps 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the target starts at 0: 0,1,2. Then 0 stays, 2 moves to 1 (1 swap), 4 moves to 2 (2 swaps). Total 3. So starting at 1 is better.\n\nAnother option: start at 2: 2,3,4. Then 0 moves to 2 (2), 2 stays, 4 stays. Total 2. Wait, same as starting at 1. Wait, but in this case, the total is 2+0+0=2. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nWait, maybe the target positions should be such that the middle element of the group is at the median of the original positions.\n\nIn the example [0,2,4], the median is 2. So the target positions would be 1,2,3 (so that the middle element is at 2). Wait, but if we have 3 elements, the middle one is the second (index 1). So t_1 should be the median of the original positions.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal target positions are such that for the sorted positions p_0 <= p_1 <= ... <= p_{k-1}, the target positions t_i = m + i, and m is chosen ", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.17333333333333334, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 2263, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert min_adjacent_swaps_grouping_letters('aabbaa')==2"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

The problem is to find the minimal number of adjacent swaps needed to group identical letters together in a string, and we can choose which letter to group. So the goal is to determine which letter, when grouped, requires the least swaps.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"grouping identical letters together\" means. For example, if the string is \"abac\", then grouping 'a's would result in \"aa bc\" (like \"aabc\" or \"baac\" but wait, no—grouping all a's together, so the string becomes \"aa\" followed by the other letters, but the other letters can be in any order as long as the a's are consecutive. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"group identical letters together\"—so for a given letter, say 'a', we need all 'a's to be adjacent. The rest of the letters can be in any order, but the 'a's must be consecutive. So the problem is, for each unique character in the string, compute the minimal adjacent swaps required to bring all instances of that character together, then pick the minimum among all those values.\n\nSo the task is: for each character c in the string, calculate the minimal swaps needed to group all c's together, then return the smallest such value.\n\nNow, how do we calculate the minimal adjacent swaps for a specific character?\n\nI remember that when you want to bring all instances of a character together, the minimal swaps can be found by considering the median position of the characters. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let's think.\n\nAdjacent swaps are equivalent to the number of inversions. For example, to move an element to a certain position, the number of swaps needed is the number of elements between its current position and target position.\n\nWait, another approach: when grouping all c's together, the optimal arrangement is to have all c's consecutive, and the relative order of the non-c characters doesn't matter (since we're only concerned with the swaps needed to group c's). So the minimal number of swaps required to group all c's is equal to the sum of the distances each c has to move to their target positions, but since swaps are adjacent, each swap moves a character by one position.\n\nWait, but how to compute this efficiently.\n\nI recall that for the problem of grouping all occurrences of a particular character with minimal adjacent swaps, the optimal way is to bring all the characters to the median position of their current positions. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think with an example.\n\nSuppose the positions of the character 'a' are [0, 2, 5] in a string of length 6.\n\nTo group them together, the target positions would be consecutive. The optimal target positions are such that the middle occurrence (the median) stays in place, and the others move towards it. Wait, perhaps the minimal total distance is achieved when the target block is centered around the median of the original positions.\n\nWait, let's take the example where positions are [0, 2, 5]. Let's say we want to group them into positions 1,2,3.

Collect all the indices where the character occurs. Let's call this list positions.\n\n2.

The target positions would be 1,2,3 (if possible), but how does that relate.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal total distance is achieved when the target block is placed such that the middle occurrence (the median) is at its original position.

The task is to find the minimal number of adjacent swaps required to group all identical letters together in a string, and we can choose which letter to group. So, for example, if the string is \"abac\", we can choose to group 'a's or 'b's or 'c's, and compute the minimal swaps needed for each case, then pick the smallest one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"group identical letters together\" means. It means that all instances of the chosen letter are consecutive. For example, in \"abac\", grouping 'a's would require moving the two 'a's to be next to each other. The possible target positions for the 'a's could be positions 0-1, 1-2, etc., but since they have to be consecutive, the minimal swaps would depend on how the letters are arranged.\n\nWait, but how do adjacent swaps work here? Each swap can only exchange two adjacent elements. The minimal number of swaps to group a particular letter is similar to the problem of finding the minimal swaps to bring all instances of that letter together.\n\nI remember that for a specific target position of the letters, the minimal swaps can be calculated by considering the median position of the letters. Or maybe it's related to the positions of the letters and how far they need to move.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a letter that occurs k times in the string. Let's collect the indices where this letter appears. Let's say the indices are [i_0, i_1, ..., i_{k-1}].\n\nWe need to move these k letters into consecutive positions. The optimal way is to place them in a block such that the total distance each letter has to move is minimized. Because each adjacent swap moves a letter by one position, the total number of swaps is equal to the sum of the distances each letter has to move, but adjusted for overlapping movements.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you move multiple elements, the swaps can interfere with each other. But there's a known approach for this problem. For example, in the problem where you need to group all 'a's together, the minimal swaps can be found by considering the median of the positions.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method I've heard about: for each target block of k consecutive positions, compute how many swaps are needed to bring all the letters into that block, and take the minimum over all possible blocks.\n\nBut how to compute the swaps for a given target block?\n\nLet's say the target block starts at position s, so it covers s to s + k - 1.\n\nFor each occurrence of the letter at position i, the target position would be s + j, where j is the index in the block (0-based). But we need to assign the original positions to the target positions in a way that minimizes the total movement.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal assignment is to sort the original positions and map them to consecutive positions in the target block. For example, if the original positions are [2,5,7], and k=3, then the target block could be [x, x+1, x+2]. The minimal total movement is achieved when the sorted original positions are mapped to the consecutive target positions in order.\n\nSo, the minimal total distance would be sum_{m=0}^{k-1} |original_position[m] - (x + m)|.\n\nTo minimize this sum, x should be chosen such that x + m is as close as possible to the original positions.\n\nBut x is the starting position of the block. However, the block must be within the string length. So for a string of length n, the block can start from 0 to n - k.\n\nBut how do we find the optimal x?\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula for the minimal total distance when moving elements to consecutive positions. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the original positions are sorted as p_0, p_1, ..., p_{k-1}.\n\nWe want to choose a starting position s such that the target positions are s, s+1, ..., s + k-1.\n\nThe total movement is sum_{i=0}^{k-1} |p_i - (s + i)|.\n\nWe can rewrite this as sum | (p_i - i) - s |.\n\nAh! Because p_i - (s + i) = (p_i - i) - s.\n\nSo the sum becomes sum | (p_i - i) - s |.\n\nThis sum is minimized when s is the median of the values (p_i - i).\n\nWait, yes!

Each query is a tuple (l, r, k), and the function should return the k-th smallest element in the subarray nums[l..r]. The problem specifies using a persistent segment tree over values.\n\nFirst, I remember that a persistent segment tree (also called a PST) is used for range queries where each version corresponds to a different state. For order statistics, especially the k-th smallest element in a range, the common approach is to use a segment tree that tracks the frequency of elements, and then use a technique similar to the merge sort tree but with persistence.\n\nWait, the classic approach for this problem is the \"merge sort tree\" with binary search, but that's O(log^2 n) per query. However, using a persistent segment tree (specifically a \"Fenwick tree\" or a \"segment tree\" that's built for order statistics), we can do it in O(log n) per query. Wait, no—the persistent segment tree approach for this is similar to the one used in the \"k-th smallest number in a range\" problem, which is often solved with a PST built on sorted values.\n\nLet me recall. The standard method is to:\n\n1. Compress the values of nums into a sorted list (coordinate compression) since the values can be large, but we only care about their relative order.\n\n2. Build a persistent segment tree where each version corresponds to the prefix of the array up to index i. Each node in the segment tree stores the count of elements in that range.\n\n3. For a query (l, r, k), we compute the segment tree versions at r and l-1, then subtract the counts to get the frequency in [l, r]. Then, traverse the two trees simultaneously to find the k-th smallest element.\n\nWait, right. The persistent segment tree here is built such that version i corresponds to the array elements from index 0 to i (assuming 0-based). So for a query [l, r], we take version r and subtract version l-1. The difference gives the counts in the interval [l, r]. Then, using binary search on the value (or traversing the segment tree), we can find the k-th smallest.\n\nBut how exactly is the persistent segment tree structured here?\n\nThe segment tree is built over the sorted unique values (after compression). Each node represents a range of values and stores the count of numbers in that range for the current version.\n\nTo build the PST:\n\n- Sort the array and get the unique values (sorted_vals).\n- For each element in the original array, we find its position in sorted_vals (using bisect).\n- We build the segment tree versions incrementally. Each version i is built by updating the position corresponding to nums[i] in the previous version.\n\nWait, but in this case, the PST is built for the entire array's values. Each version i (after processing the first i+1 elements) has counts of how many elements are <= a certain value up to that index.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe standard approach for the k-th smallest in range using PST is as follows:\n\n1. Compress the input array into a sorted array of unique elements, say sorted_vals.\n2. Create an array of the positions of each element in the compressed array (so for each nums[i], pos[i] = index in sorted_vals).\n3. Build a persistent segment tree where each version i (starting from 0) corresponds to the first i+1 elements. Each node in the segment tree stores the count of elements in the range covered by that node for version i.\n4. To answer a query (l, r, k), we take the segment tree versions at r and l-1. The difference in counts between these two versions gives the count of elements in the range [l, r] for each value range.\n5. Then, starting from the root, we determine whether the k-th element is in the left or right subtree by checking the count in the left subtree (version r's left count minus version l-1's left count). If the left count >= k, go left; else, go right with k = k - left_count.\n\nWait, but how exactly is the tree traversed?\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, coordinate compression:\n\nsorted_vals = sorted(set(nums))\nc", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.17333333333333334, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 2509, "metadata": {"tests": ["nums=[5,1,2,3,4]; qs=[(1,3,2),(0,4,3)]; assert kth_order_statistic_pst(nums,qs)==[2,3]"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

The key here is to use a persistent segment tree over the values.\n\nFirst, I remember that a persistent segment tree is used for range queries where we want to track different versions of the tree. For order statistics, the common approach is to use a segment tree that tracks the count of elements in certain ranges, and then perform a binary search over the values to find the k-th smallest.\n\nWait, the persistent segment tree for this problem is usually built by coordinate compression first. Since the values can be large, we map them to indices in a sorted array. Then, the segment tree nodes store the count of numbers up to that point.\n\nThe standard method is to create a segment tree for each prefix of the array. Each version of the tree represents the counts of elements from the start up to that index. Then, for a query (l, r, k), we can subtract the tree at version l-1 from the tree at version r to get the count of elements in the range [l, r]. Then, we traverse the two trees (version r and version l-1) simultaneously to find the k-th smallest element.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compress the values of nums. Sort the unique values, then map each number to its index in the sorted list.\n\n2. Build a persistent segment tree where each version i corresponds to the prefix nums[0..i-1] (assuming 0-based). Each node in the segment tree represents a range of compressed values and stores the count of numbers in that range for the current prefix.\n\n3. For each query (l, r, k), we need to find the smallest value such that there are at least k numbers <= it in the range [l, r]. This is done by querying the difference between the segment tree at version r and version l-1.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the query is (l, r, k), so the subarray from l to r inclusive. So if the array is 0-based, the versions would be built such that version i includes nums[0..i]. Then, for query [l, r], we use version r and version l-1.\n\nBut first, the coordinate compression. Let's say sorted_vals = sorted(set(nums)), then a mapping from value to index.\n\nThen, for each element in nums, we get its compressed index.\n\nBuilding the persistent segment tree: each update inserts the compressed index into the tree. The tree is built incrementally for each element.\n\nThe persistent segment tree is typically implemented with a structure where each node has left and right children, and a count. When updating, we create new nodes along the path, copying the other child from the previous version.\n\nSo for the initial version (empty tree), we have a root. Then for each index i from 0 to n-1, we update the tree to include nums[i]'s compressed index, creating a new root for version i+1.\n\nWait, maybe versions are 1-based. Let's say version 0 is empty, version 1 is after first element, etc. So for a query [l, r], we need version r+1 minus version l.\n\nWait, if the array is 0-based, then the prefix up to index r (inclusive) is version r+1, and prefix up to l-1 is version l. So the difference gives the count in [l, r].\n\nYes.

Or we build the empty tree by a recursive function that builds the entire structure? \n   However, building the entire empty tree for [0, m-1] would be O(m) which is acceptable? But note: m can be up to n (if distinct) and n can be large (like 10^5) so building a full tree of size 4*m is acceptable? \n   But persistent segment trees are built dynamically so we don't build the entire tree at the beginning.

Let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that a persistent segment tree (PST) is used for range queries where we want to query different versions of the data structure. In this case, the versions correspond to the elements of the array as we process them from left to right. Each version of the segment tree represents the count of elements up to that index.\n\nWait, the problem is about finding the k-th smallest in nums[l..r]. So the standard approach for this is to use a PST that's built over the sorted unique values of the array. Each node in the segment tree stores the count of elements in a certain value range. When building the PST, each version i (after processing the i-th element) has the counts for the first i elements.\n\nBut how does the query work? For a query (l, r, k), we can take the segment trees at versions r and l-1. The difference between these two trees gives the count of elements in the subarray nums[l..r]. Then, we traverse both trees simultaneously to find the k-th smallest element.\n\nRight. So steps needed:\n\n1. Preprocess the array: get the sorted unique values (this will be the \"values\" over which the segment tree is built).\n2. Compress the original nums array into indices corresponding to the sorted unique values. So each element becomes its rank in the sorted array.\n3. Build the persistent segment tree. Each version i (0-based) corresponds to the first i+1 elements (since we start from version 0). Wait, maybe versions are 1-based. Need to check.\n\nWait, the PST is built by inserting each element one by one. So for each position i (from 0 to n-1), we create a new version by updating the count for the compressed value of nums[i].\n\nThen, for a query (l, r, k), we need the versions r and l-1. Because the version r includes elements up to index r (assuming 0-based), and version l-1 includes up to l-1. So the difference gives the count in [l, r].\n\nWait, the problem states the query is (l, r, k), which is nums[l..r]. So if the array is 0-based, then the segment from l to r inclusive. So the versions would be: version r+1 minus version l. Because version i has the first i elements (if we start versions at 1). Hmm, need to be precise.\n\nLet me think: suppose the original array is nums[0..n-1]. We build the PST such that version i (for i from 0 to n) represents the state after processing the first i elements. So version 0 is empty. Version 1 has nums[0], version 2 has nums[0..1], etc.\n\nThen, to query the subarray from l to r (0-based), we need version r+1 minus version l. Because version r+1 has elements up to index r, and version l has up to index l-1. So the difference is elements from l to r.\n\nWait, for example, if l=0 and r=0 (the first element), then version 1 (r+1=1) minus version 0 (l=0) gives the count for the first element. Yes.\n\nSo the query function would take two roots: root_r = roots[r+1], root_l = roots[l], and then compute the difference.\n\nNow, building the PST. Each node in the segment tree covers a range of values (the compressed indices). The tree is built over the range [0, size-1], where size is the number of unique values.\n\nEach update (adding a new element) increments the count in the corresponding leaf and propagates up.\n\nThe PST is built by creating new nodes along the path of the update, so each version is a modified path from the root.\n\nNow, for the k-th smallest element: during the query, we start at the roots of version r+1 and version l. The count in the left subtree for the current range is (left_count_r - left_count_l). If this count is >=k, then the k-th element is in the left subtree.

Create a boolean list (or array) of size n+1, initialized to True. The indices represent numbers from 0 to n.\n2. Mark 0 and 1 as False since they're not primes.\n3. Start with the first prime number, 2. Mark all multiples of 2 as non-prime.\n4. Move to the next unmarked number (which is a prime) and repeat the process until you've processed up to sqrt(n).\n5. Count the number of True values in the list, which correspond to primes.\n\nWait, but for efficiency, once you reach a prime p, you can start marking from p*p because smaller multiples would have been marked by previous primes. Also, the loop for primes only needs to go up to sqrt(n) since any composite number up to n must have a factor less than or equal to sqrt(n).\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nInitialize a list called is_prime of length n+1, all True.

So, for example, if n is 25, sqrt(n) is 5, so we check up to 5.\n\nAfter processing, sum the True values in is_prime.\n\nWait, but how to handle the loop for i? Let's say n is 10. Then sqrt(10) is about 3.16, so i goes up to 3.\n\nFor i=2: mark 4,6,8,10.\nFor i=3: mark 9.\ni=4 is already marked as non-prime, so skip.\nThen count primes up to 10: 2,3,5,7 → 4 primes.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\n- If n < 2, return 0 because there are no primes less than 2.\n\nWait, the function should return the count of primes up to and including n, but primes start at 2.\n\nSo edge case: if n is 0 or 1, return 0.\n\nLet's code this.\n\nFirst, handle the base case where n < 2. Then create the sieve.\n\nWait, but the problem says count_primes_upto(n), so for n=2, it should return 1.\n\nLet me test with n=2.\n\nis_prime array is [False, False, True] for indices 0,1,2.\n\nAfter sieve:\n\ni starts at 2. sqrt(2) is ~1.414, so the loop for i in 2 to int(sqrt(n)) would not run, because 2 > 1.414. Wait, but 2 is a prime. Wait, in this case, the sieve would correctly have is_prime[2] as True.\n\nWait, the loop for i should go up to sqrt(n), but if n is 2, sqrt(n) is ~1.414, so the loop doesn't run. So the sieve remains with 2 as prime, which is correct.\n\nSo the loop for i starts at 2, and goes up to int(sqrt(n)) inclusive.\n\nWait, in Python, the range for i would be from 2 to int(n**0.5) + 1.\n\nBecause for example, if n is 25, sqrt(25) is 5, so the range should include 5.\n\nSo the code would be for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) +1):\n\nBut wait, if n is 10, sqrt(10) is ~3.16, so int(n**0.5) is 3.

Continue this process up to sqrt(n), because any composite number larger than sqrt(n) would have a factor less than or equal to sqrt(n).\n\nWait, but for the sieve, you only need to check up to the square root of n. So the loop for the sieve should run from 2 to int(sqrt(n)) + 1.\n\nWait, let's see. For example, if n is 10, sqrt(10) is about 3.16. So the loop runs up to 3. Then 5 and 7 would be primes.

The primes are 2,3,5,7. So sum should be 4.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAfter processing:\nIndices 2: T, 3: T, 4: F,5: T,6: F,7: T,8: F,9: F,10: F.\n\nWait, 5 is still True.

Hmm, first, what's the definition of median here? For a subarray of odd length, the median is the middle element when sorted. For even length, sometimes it's the lower median or upper median, but I think the problem probably specifies that the median is the middle element when sorted, so for even length, maybe it's not considered? Wait, the problem statement says \"median equals k\", but I need to check the standard definition.\n\nWait, in many programming problems, especially when dealing with medians in subarrays, the median for even-length subarrays is often defined as the element at position (length-1)//2 when sorted. So for example, a subarray of length 4 (indices 0-3 when sorted), the median would be the element at index 1 (0-based), which is the second smallest. So in that case, the median is the (n//2)-th element for 0-based? Wait, let's clarify:\n\nIf the subarray has m elements, sorted, then the median is the element at position floor((m-1)/2). So for m odd: (m-1)/2 is integer, e.g., m=5 → 2nd index. For m even: m=4 → (3)/2=1.5 → floor is 1, so index 1. So the median is the ( (m-1)//2 )-th element in the sorted subarray.\n\nBut the problem says the median equals k. So for a subarray to have median k, when sorted, the element at position (m-1)//2 must be k.\n\nSo the task is to count all contiguous subarrays where, when sorted, the middle element (as per above) is exactly k.\n\nNow, how to approach this?\n\nBrute force would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for large n. But maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: For each subarray that contains k, check if k is the median. But even that might not be efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps we can transform the problem. Let's think about properties of the median.\n\nFor a subarray to have median k, two conditions must hold:\n\n1. The subarray must contain k (since the median is k, which is present in the array).\n\n2. In the subarray, there are at least floor(m/2) elements less than or equal to k, and at least floor(m/2) elements greater than or equal to k. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think.\n\nWait, when the subarray is sorted, the median is the middle element. So for the median to be k, exactly:\n\n- At least ceil(m/2) elements are >=k (since the median is k, and all elements from the median onwards are >=k).\n\n- At least ceil(m/2) elements are <=k (since the median is k, and all elements up to the median are <=k).\n\nWait, perhaps another way. Let's consider for each subarray that contains k, how many elements are less than k, equal to k, and greater than k.\n\nWait, maybe we can model this with a balance approach. Let's think of transforming the array into a new array where:\n\n- For elements less than k, assign -1.\n\n- For elements equal to k, assign 0.\n\n- For elements greater than k, assign +1.\n\nWait, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, since the median is k, in the sorted subarray, the number of elements less than k should be <= the number of elements greater than or equal to k, but perhaps more precise:\n\nLet m be the length of the subarray.\n\nThe median is at position t = (m-1)//2.\n\nSo in the sorted subarray, the element at t is k.\n\nThat means there are t elements before it (which are <=k), and (m-1 - t) elements after it (which are >=k).\n\nWait, but since the element at t is k, all elements before are <=k, and all after are >=k.\n\nBut to have the median exactly k, the element at t must be k. So in the subarray, there must be at least (t+1) elements that are >=k (since the t-th element is k, and the elements after are >=k). Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, for the median to be k, the number of elements less than k in the subarray must be <= floor((m-1)/2), and the number of elements greater than k must also be <= floor((m-1)/2).

Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the median of a subarray depends on whether the length is odd or even. Wait, the problem says \"median equals k\". But sometimes median definitions vary. For example, in some contexts, when the length is even, the median is the lower of the two middle numbers. Wait, but the problem statement probably specifies it. Wait, the problem says \"median equals k\". Hmm, maybe we need to check how the problem defines the median here.\n\nWait, the problem statement doesn't specify, but in programming problems like this, often the median for even-length subarrays is considered as the (n-1)/2-th element when sorted, which would be the lower median. Wait, no. Wait, for example, in some problems, when the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, but that's a float, which can't be equal to k (an integer). So perhaps the problem defines the median as the middle element when the subarray length is odd, and maybe the problem only considers subarrays of odd length. Wait, but the problem statement says \"count subarrays where median equals k\", so maybe they define the median as the (floor((n-1)/2)) element, which would be the lower median. Wait, but I need to check.\n\nWait, let's think. For example, if the subarray is [1,2,3], median is 2. If it's [1,2,3,4], then depending on definition, median could be 2 or 2.5. But since k is an integer, the median must be an integer. Therefore, the problem must be considering only subarrays where the median is an integer, which would happen when the subarray length is odd (since for even length, the median would be the average of two numbers, which may not be integer). Wait, but the problem says \"median equals k\", so perhaps the problem is considering the median as the middle element when sorted, regardless of even or odd. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the problem defines the median as the element at position floor((length-1)/2) when sorted. So for even length, like 4 elements, it's the 1st index (0-based), which is the second element. So for [1,2,3,4], the median would be 2. Then in that case, the median is always an element of the array, so it can be equal to k.\n\nBut I need to confirm. Let's see examples. Suppose k is 2. Then a subarray [1,2,3] has median 2. A subarray [2,3,4] has median 3. For a subarray of even length, say [1,2,3,4], sorted is [1,2,3,4], the median would be the element at position (4-1)/2 = 1.5 floored to 1, so index 1, which is 2. So the median is 2. So that subarray would count if k=2.\n\nWait, but in some definitions, the median for even n is the average of the two middle elements, but since that's not an integer here, the problem must be using the definition where the median is the element at position floor((n-1)/2) in the sorted subarray. So for any subarray, the median is the element at position m = (length - 1) // 2. So for length 1: m=0, median is the element. For length 2: m=0, median is first element when sorted. For length 3: m=1, second element. Etc.\n\nSo, given that, the problem is to count all subarrays where, when sorted, the element at position (len-1)//2 is equal to k.\n\nHmm.

Wait, for even-length arrays, sometimes the median is considered as the average of the two middle numbers, but in this problem, since we're dealing with integers and checking if it's equal to k, which is an integer, the average would have to be integer. But the problem states that the median equals k, so maybe they define the median as the middle element when the subarray length is odd, and perhaps for even-length subarrays, it's the lower or upper one. Wait, but the problem statement might have a specific definition. Wait, maybe the problem defines the median as the element at position floor((n-1)/2) when sorted. For example, for n=3, it's the 1st index (0-based), for n=4, it's the 1st index (since (4-1)/2 = 1.5, floor is 1). Wait, but maybe the problem uses the definition where for even-length subarrays, the median is the (n/2 - 1)th element. Or maybe the problem only considers subarrays of odd length? Wait, the problem says \"subarrays where median equals k\". Let me check some examples.\n\nWait, maybe the problem defines the median as follows: for a subarray of length m, the median is the element at position (m-1)//2 when sorted. So for m=1: index 0, m=2: index 0 (since (2-1)//2=0), m=3: index 1, m=4: index 1 (since (4-1)//2=1.5 floored to 1), etc. Wait, but that would mean for even m, the median is the lower of the two middle elements. Alternatively, maybe the problem defines the median as the element at position m//2 when sorted. For example, m=1: 0, m=2: 1, m=3: 1, m=4: 2. Wait, but then for m=2, the median is the second element (0-based index 1), which is the higher one. Hmm, this is critical because it affects how we count.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's definition is that the median is the middle element when the subarray is sorted, and if the length is even, the median is the smaller of the two middle elements. Or maybe the problem is from a specific source where the median is defined as the (m+1)//2-th element, which for m even would be the upper median. Wait, but this is unclear. However, in many programming problems, when the problem refers to the median of a subarray as an element (not the average), they usually take the (m-1)//2-th index. For example, LeetCode problem 2488 has a similar definition where the median is the element at position (length-1)//2 when sorted. Let me check that problem. In LeetCode 2488, the median is defined as the middle element in the sorted subarray, and for even length, it's the lower middle element. So for a subarray of length m, the median is the element at index (m-1)//2 in the sorted array. So for m=3: index 1, m=4: index 1 (since (4-1)//2=1.5 floored to 1). So the median is the lower of the two middle elements when m is even.\n\nSo assuming that's the case here, the problem is to count all subarrays where, when sorted, the element at index (m-1)//2 equals k.\n\nNow, the challenge is to efficiently count such subarrays.

Let's think: for the median to be k, when sorted, the middle element is k. So in the subarray, there must be at least t elements <=k, where t is (m+1)//2 (since the median is the t-th smallest element). Wait, for m elements, sorted as a_0 <= a_1 <= ... <= a_{m-1}, the median is a_{(m-1)//2}. So for this to equal k, a_{(m-1)//2} =k. That means that in the subarray, there are at least (m+1)//2 elements that are <=k (since the median is k, so all elements up to the median are <=k), and at least (m+1)//2 elements that are >=k (since the median is k, elements from the median onwards are >=k).\n\nWait, perhaps a better way: Let's consider for each subarray that contains k, how to check if k is the median.\n\nFirst, the subarray must contain k. Because if the median is k, then k must be present in the subarray.\n\nSo we can focus on subarrays that include at least one occurrence of k.\n\nBut wait, suppose there are multiple k's.

I need to find the minimum time difference between any two times in a circular clock. The input is a list of strings representing times in \"HH:MM\" format. Since it's a circular clock, the time wraps around after 24 hours, so the minimum difference could be the shorter way around the clock.\n\nFirst, I should convert all the times into minutes since midnight. That makes it easier to compute differences. For example, \"01:30\" becomes 90 minutes.\n\nOnce converted, I can sort the list of minutes. Sorting helps because the minimum difference is likely between consecutive times, but since it's circular, the last and first elements also need to be checked (like 23:59 and 00:01 would have a 2-minute difference).\n\nWait, but after sorting, the list is in ascending order. So the possible candidates for minimum difference are between each adjacent pair in the sorted list, and also between the last element and the first element (plus 1440 minutes for the circular wrap-around).\n\nLet me think. For example, if the sorted times in minutes are [t0, t1, ..., tn-1], then the differences are t1 - t0, t2 - t1, ..., tn-1 - tn-2, and (t0 + 1440) - tn-1.

Let's see: the time difference between the last time (say 1439 minutes, which is 23:59) and the first time (1 minute, 00:01) is 2 minutes (since 1439 to 1440 is 1 minute, then 0 to 1 is another minute, total 2). But in minutes, the circular difference would be (1 + 1440) - 1439 = 2. So yes, the formula is (first + 1440) - last.\n\nSo for the circular case, the difference is (sorted[0] + 1440) - sorted[-1].\n\nBut wait, after sorting, the list is in order, so the regular consecutive differences are sorted[i] - sorted[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1. Then the circular difference is sorted[0] + 1440 - sorted[-1].\n\nWait, but the minimum difference could be either the smallest consecutive difference or the circular one. So all these need to be considered.\n\nFor example, if all times are spread out, the circular difference might be the smallest.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Convert all times to minutes.\n- Sort the list.\n- Compute min( (sorted[i] - sorted[i-1]) for all i from 1 to n-1, and (sorted[0] + 1440 - sorted[-1]) )\n\nWait, but the circular difference is 1440 - (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]) if sorted[-1] > sorted[0], but since it's sorted, sorted[-1] >= sorted[0]. So the circular difference is 1440 - (sorted[-1] - sorted[0])? Wait no, because the actual time difference between sorted[-1] and sorted[0] on a circular clock is min( sorted[0] + 1440 - sorted[-1], sorted[-1] - sorted[0] ). But since the list is sorted, sorted[-1] >= sorted[0], so sorted[-1] - sorted[0] is the direct difference, but the circular one would be 1440 - (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]) if that's smaller. Wait, no. Wait, the minimum time difference between two times on a 24-hour clock is the minimum of |a - b| and 1440 - |a - b|.\n\nBut since we have sorted the list, for consecutive elements, the difference is positive and less than 1440 (assuming no duplicates). Wait, but if two times are the same, the difference is 0.\n\nSo for each adjacent pair in the sorted list, the difference is sorted[i] - sorted[i-1], which is the direct difference.

I need to find the minimum time difference in minutes between any two times in a list, considering a circular clock. So, the clock is 24-hour, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says \"circular clock,\" but typically time differences on a 24-hour clock would be circular. Wait, but maybe it's a 12-hour clock? Hmm, the problem statement says \"minimum minutes difference on circular clock (variant name)\". Wait, the example times are probably given in HH:MM format. Let me think.\n\nWait, the input is a list of strings like [\"23:59\", \"00:00\"]. So, these are 24-hour times. Because 23:59 is valid in 24-hour. So the clock is 24 hours, which is 1440 minutes (24*60). So the circular aspect is that the time wraps around after 24 hours. So the maximum possible difference between two times is 720 minutes (12 hours), because beyond that, it's shorter the other way.\n\nSo the problem is: given a list of times in \"HH:MM\" format, find the smallest difference between any two times, considering that the clock is circular (so the difference between 23:59 and 00:00 is 1 minute, not 1439).\n\nFirst step: convert each time string into total minutes since midnight. For example, \"01:30\" becomes 90 minutes.\n\nThen, sort the list of minutes. Once sorted, the minimal difference is either between consecutive elements, or between the last and first (because of the circular nature).\n\nWait, but in a circular list, the minimal difference could be between the last element and the first element plus 1440 (since the total minutes in a day is 1440). Wait, let's think.\n\nSuppose we have sorted times in minutes: [t0, t1, ..., tn-1], sorted in ascending order.\n\nThe possible minimal differences are:\n\n- For each i from 0 to n-2, t_{i+1} - t_i.\n\n- Also, (t0 + 1440) - t_{n-1}, which is the wrap-around difference.\n\nBecause the clock is circular, the difference between the last time and the first time is min(t0 + 1440 - t_{n-1}, t_{n-1} - t0), but since the list is sorted, t_{n-1} >= t0, so t_{n-1} - t0 would be the direct difference, but the wrap-around is 1440 - (t_{n-1} - t0). Wait, no. Wait, the total circle is 1440 minutes, so the minimal difference between two times a and b is min(|a - b|, 1440 - |a - b|). But when sorted, for consecutive elements in the sorted list (including the wrap-around), the minimal difference would be the smallest of (next - current) for all adjacent pairs (including last and first +1440).\n\nWait, for example, if sorted times are [100, 200, 1300]. Then the differences are 100 (200-100), 1100 (1300-200), and (100 +1440 -1300)=240. So the minimal is 100. But the actual minimal difference between 1300 and 100 is min(1200, 240) which is 240, but in the sorted list, the consecutive differences (including wrap-around) would capture the minimal possible.\n\nWait, but when the list is sorted, the minimal non-wrap difference is between consecutive elements, and the wrap-around difference is between the last and first. So the minimal of all those is the answer.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n1. Convert all times to minutes.\n\n2. Sort the list.\n\n3. Compute the differences between consecutive elements (including the wrap-around difference between last and first +1440).\n\n4. The minimal difference is the smallest among these.\n\nWait, but for the wrap-around, it's (first element + 1440) - last element.\n\nBecause the sorted list is in order, so the last element is the largest. The difference between first and last in the sorted list is last - first. The wrap-around difference is 1440 - (last - first), but since the clock is circular, the minimal difference between first and last is min(last - first, 1440 - (last - first)), but in the sorted list, the consecutive elements after sorting will have the minimal non-wrap differences. However, the wrap-around difference (first +1440 - last) is the actual minimal possible for that pair.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose times are [\"23:59\", \"00:00\"]. Converted to minutes: [1439, 0]. Sort them: [0, 1439].

I need to find the minimum time difference in minutes between any two times in a list, considering a circular clock. So, since it's a circular clock, the time wraps around at 24:00, which is the same as 00:00. The minimum difference could be the smaller of the two possible differences between two times (the forward and backward on the circle).\n\nFirst, I need to convert each time string into minutes since midnight. For example, \"01:30\" becomes 90 minutes. Then, sort all these minute values. Once sorted, the minimum difference is usually between consecutive times. But because it's circular, the difference between the last and first time (wrapping around) also needs to be considered.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the circular part? Let's think. Suppose we have times sorted in ascending order. The differences between consecutive elements are checked, but also the difference between the first time plus 24*60 (1440 minutes) and the last time. Because the clock is circular, the time after 23:59 is 00:00.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Convert each time string to minutes. Split each string by colon, convert hours to minutes and add the minutes part.\n\n2. Sort the list of minutes.\n\n3. Compute the differences between consecutive elements. The minimum difference here is a candidate.\n\n4. Also compute the difference between the first element + 1440 and the last element. Because the circular difference would be (first + 1440) - last, which is equivalent to 1440 - (last - first), but maybe not. Wait, for example, if the last time is 23:00 (1380 minutes) and the first is 01:00 (60), then the circular difference is 60 + (1440 - 1380) = 60 + 60 = 120 minutes. Wait, no. Wait, 23:00 to 01:00 is 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. How to calculate that? The total minutes in a day is 1440. So the difference between 1380 (23:00) and 60 (01:00) is min( |60 - 1380|, 1440 - |60 -1380| ). But 1380 -60 is 1320, so the other way is 1440 -1320 = 120. So the minimum is 120.\n\nBut when the list is sorted, the last element is 1380, first is 60. So the circular difference would be (60 + 1440) - 1380 = 1500 -1380 = 120. So yes, that's correct. So the circular difference is (first + 1440) - last.\n\nSo after sorting, the minimum difference is the minimum between the smallest consecutive difference and (first + 1440 - last).\n\nWait, but when there are only two times, for example, 23:00 and 01:00. Then sorted list is [60, 1380]. The consecutive difference is 1320, and the circular is 120, which is the minimum.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- Convert all times to minutes.\n\n- Sort the list.\n\n- Compute min_diff as the minimum between (list[i+1] - list[i] for all i) and (list[0] + 1440 - list[-1]).\n\nBut wait, when there are multiple times, the minimal difference could be between any two consecutive times in the sorted list, or the wrap-around between last and first.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Convert to minutes.\n\n2. Sort.\n\n3. Compute the minimal consecutive difference.\n\n4. Compute the circular difference (first + 1440 - last).\n\n5. The answer is the minimum between the minimal consecutive difference and the circular difference.\n\nWait, but for example, if the list is [0, 60, 120], sorted. The consecutive differences are 60, 60. The circular difference is 0 +1440 -120=1320. So the minimum is 60.\n\nAnother example: times are [\"23:59\", \"00:00\", \"12:00\"]. Converted to [1439, 0, 720]. Sorted becomes [0, 720, 1439].\n\nConsecutive differences: 720-0=720, 1439-720=719. The circular difference is 0 +1440 -1439 =1. So the minimum is 1.\n\nWait, but between 1439 and 0, the difference is 1 minute (since 0 is next day's 00:00). So yes, the circular difference here is 1, which is the minimal.\n\nSo the algorithm would correctly capture that.\n\nAnother example: times = [\"05:00\", \"10:00\", \"15:00\"]. Converted to [300, 600, 900]. Sorted. Consecutive differences 300 each. Circular difference is 300 +1440 -900 = 840. So the minimum is 300.\n\nWait, but the circular difference here is 1440 - (900 -300) = 1440-600=840, which is larger than 300, so the minimal is 300.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, edge cas", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.17333333333333334, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 1729, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert minimum_time_difference_circular(['23:59','00:00'])==1"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

I need to find the minimum time difference in minutes for a list of times on a circular clock. So, the clock is circular, meaning 24:00 is the same as 00:00.

But since it's circular, the smallest difference could also be between the last and first time when wrapped around.\n\nWait, right. For example, if the times are [\"23:59\", \"00:00\"], the minimum difference is 1 minute, not 1439. So the circular aspect means we have to consider the wrap-around.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Convert each time string to minutes since start of day (00:00). So \"HH:MM\" becomes (HH*60 + MM).\n2. Sort the list of minutes.\n3. Compute the differences between consecutive times, including the difference between the last and first (with the circular wrap).\n\nWait, but how to handle the circular part. Let's think: the total minutes in a day is 1440 (24*60). So the difference between the last time and the first time when considering the circle would be 1440 - (last - first), but only if last > first. Wait, no. Wait, if sorted, the list is in increasing order. So the sorted list's last element is the largest. The circular difference would be (first + 1440) - last. Because after the last time, the next occurrence is the first time of the next day.\n\nWait, for example, if sorted times are [t0, t1, ..., tn-1], then the possible differences are t1 - t0, t2 - t1, ..., tn-1 - tn-2, and (t0 + 1440) - tn-1. The minimum of all these is the answer.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the approach is:\n\n- Convert all times to minutes.\n- Sort the list.\n- Compute the min difference between consecutive elements, including the wrap-around.\n\nSo for example, times [\"23:59\", \"00:00\"] become [1439, 0]. Sort to [0, 1439]. Then consecutive differences are 1439 - 0 = 1439, and the wrap-around is (0 + 1440) - 1439 = 1. So the minimum is 1.\n\nAnother example: [\"01:00\", \"02:00\", \"03:00\"].

The consecutive differences are 60 (120-60), 60 (180-120), and the wrap-around is (60 + 1440) - 180 = 1320. So the minimum is 60.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. Convert each time to minutes.\n2. Sort the list.\n3. Initialize min_diff to a large number.\n4. For i from 1 to len(times)-1: compute diff = times[i] - times[i-1], update min_diff if diff is smaller.\n5.

Then the difference would be zero, which is the minimum possible.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"minimum minutes difference on circular clock\", so duplicates would give 0, which is correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"circular\", but even in standard problems, duplicates would have zero difference, but perhaps the problem assumes all times are distinct? But the function should handle duplicates.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\n- Convert all times to minutes.\n- If there are duplicates, return 0. Wait, but when sorted, consecutive elements would have zero difference. So when we check consecutive differences, duplicates would be caught.\n\nWait, for example, if two times are same, their difference is zero, which would be the min.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\n- Only one time?

The signing process involves generating a nonce k, computing the point (x, y) = k*G, then r = x mod n. If r is 0, we need to pick another k, but according to the problem statement, k is deterministic: hash(msg) % n + 1. Wait, the hash is defined as msg % 1_000_003. So k = (msg % 1_000_003) % n + 1. Wait, the problem says k = hash(msg) % n + 1, and the hash is msg % 1_000_003. So first compute hash = msg % 1000003, then k = (hash % n) + 1. But wait, maybe it's hash(msg) = msg % 1000003, then k = (hash) % n + 1. Wait, the problem says \"deterministic nonce k=hash(msg)%n+1 (use simple hash: msg%1_000_003)\".

So k is computed as (msg % 1000003) % n, then add 1. Wait, but if (msg % 1000003) % n is 0, then k would be 1. But k must be in [1, n-1]. Wait, the problem says k = hash(msg) % n + 1. Wait, that would be (hash(msg) % n) + 1. But if hash(msg) % n is n-1, then k would be n, which is invalid because k must be less than n. Hmm, but the problem statement says \"k=hash(msg)%n+1\". Wait, maybe it's (hash(msg) + 1) % n, but the problem says \"hash(msg)%n + 1\". So for example, if hash(msg) is 5 and n is 10, then 5%10=5, +1=6. But if hash is 9, then 9%10=9, +1=10, which equals n. But k must be in [1, n-1]. So this could be a problem. Wait, but the problem says \"k=hash(msg)%n +1\", so maybe the problem assumes that hash(msg) %n is in [0, n-1], so adding 1 would make it [1, n]. But k must be less than n, so if it's n, then it's invalid. However, the problem says to use this k, so perhaps we have to check if k is 0 or >=n and adjust. Wait, but the problem statement says \"k=hash(msg)%n +1\". So perhaps the problem expects us to use that formula, and if k >=n, then maybe it's invalid. But the problem says \"deterministic nonce k=hash(msg)%n+1\", so maybe we have to use it as is, even if k is out of range. But ECDSA requires k to be in [1, n-1]. So perhaps the problem expects that the hash function's output mod n is in [0, n-1], then adding 1 gives [1, n]. So if k equals n, then it's invalid. But in practice, ECDSA would require choosing another k, but the problem says to use this deterministic k. So maybe the problem assumes that k is valid (i.e., k < n), but the problem doesn't specify handling that. Wait, the problem says \"k=hash(msg)%n +1\", so perhaps we have to compute k as (hash % n) +1, but if that's >=n, then maybe it's invalid. However, the problem says \"Return True if verify works.\" So perhaps during signing, if k is invalid (e.g., k >=n), the signature would be invalid, so the verification would fail. But the problem is to implement the sign and verify steps as per the given k.\n\nSo steps for signing:\n\n1. Compute k = (msg % 1000003) % n + 1. Wait, but (msg % 1000003) is the hash, then k = (hash) % n + 1. Wait, no: the problem says \"k=hash(msg)%n +1\", and hash(msg) is msg%1_000_003. So k = (msg % 1000003) % n + 1? Or is it (msg % 1000003) % (n) +1? Let's parse the problem statement: \"k=hash(msg)%n+1 (use simple hash: msg%1_000_003)\". So hash(msg) is msg%1000003, then k = (hash(msg)) % n + 1. Wait, no: hash(msg) % n +1. So hash is computed as msg%1000003, then take that value mod n, then add 1. So k = ( (msg % 1000003) % n ) + 1.\n\nWait, but modulo n of a number that's already mod n is redundant. So (msg % 1000003) could be larger than n, so taking mod n again. For example, if n is 10, and msg%1000003 is 15, then 15%10=5, then +1=6. So k=6.\n\nBut k must be in [1, n-1]. So if ( (msg%1000003) %n ) +1 >=n, then k is invalid.

Wait, the problem says \"deterministic nonce k=hash(msg)%n+1\". So perhaps the problem assumes that (hash(msg) %n) is in 0..n-1, so adding 1 gives 1..n. But if it's n, then k is n, which is 0 mod n, which is invalid. So maybe the problem expects us to take k = (hash(...) % (n-1)) +1? But the problem says exactly \"hash(msg)%n +1\". Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem's hash function is defined as (msg % 1_000_003) %n, then +1. So k = ((msg % 1000003) % n) +1. But even then, if (msg % 1000003) %n is n-1, then k = n, which is 0 mod n. So that's a problem. But the problem says \"use deterministic nonce k=hash(msg)%n+1 (use simple hash: msg%1_000_003)\". So perhaps the code should compute k as (msg % 1000003) % n, then add 1. So k = ((msg % 1000003) % n) + 1. But then if that results in k >=n, we need to take k mod n? Wait, but the problem statement says to use that k. Maybe the problem assumes that n is large enough that (msg % 1000003) +1 is less than n? Not sure, but the problem says to use exactly that formula.\n\nSo for the sign function:\n\nk = (msg % 1_000_003) % n + 1\n\nBut wait, (msg % 1_000_003) is between 0 and 1_000_002. Then %n would be between 0 and n-1. Then +1 gives 1 to n. But if n is larger than 1_000_003, then (msg % 1_000_003) is less than n, so %n is the same as the value. So k = (msg % 1_000_003) +1. But if msg is very large, but modulo 1_000_003 first.\n\nWait, the problem says \"simple hash: msg%1_000_003\". So hash = msg % 1_000_003. Then k = hash % n +1. So k = (msg % 1_000_003) % n +1.\n\nBut for ECDSA, k must be in [1, n-1]. So if (hash %n) is n-1, then k = n, which is 0 mod n. So that's invalid. But the problem says to use this k, so perhaps we have to check if k is 0 and handle it? Wait, the problem says \"deterministic nonce k=hash(msg)%n+1\", so maybe the code should compute k as (hash +1) mod n, but if it's 0, then set to 1? Or maybe the problem expects that k is always valid. Hmm, but the problem statement says \"using deterministic nonce k=hash(msg)%n+1\", so perhaps in the code, we just compute k as (msg % 1_000_003) %n +1, and then if k >=n, subtract n? Or maybe the problem assumes that (msg % 1_000_003) is less than n-1, so k is in [1, n-1]. Not sure, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, we can proceed with k as given, and if k is 0, then it's invalid, but the problem says to use this k, so maybe the code should proceed.\n\nNow, the steps for signing:\n\n1. Compute k = (msg % 1_000_003) % n + 1. Wait, no: hash = msg % 1_000_003, then k = hash %n +1.\n\nWait, the problem says \"k=hash(msg)%n+1 (use simple hash: msg%1_000_003)\". So hash(msg) is msg%1_000_003, then k = (hash(msg)) %n +1.\n\nSo k = ( (msg % 1_000_003) % n ) + 1.\n\nBut since (msg % 1_000_003) is already less than 1_000_003, which may be smaller or larger than n.

Here, they specify using hash = msg % 1_000_003. Then k = hash % n + 1. Wait, the problem says k = hash(msg) % n + 1. So hash is msg % 1_000_003, then take that result mod n, add 1.

But since mod n already gives a value between 0 and n-1, adding 1 would make it 1 to n. But k must be in [1, n-1], so if (hash % n) +1 equals n, then it would be 0, which is invalid. Wait, no: (hash % n) is between 0 and n-1. So adding 1 gives 1 to n. But if it's n, then k = n, which is invalid because k must be less than n. Wait, the problem says k = hash(...) % n + 1. So if hash % n is n-1, then k = (n-1) +1 = n, which is invalid. So perhaps the problem expects that k is in 1..n-1, but the formula as given might sometimes produce k = n. Hmm, but maybe in practice, since n is the order of the curve, which is a prime (assuming it's a prime order group), but n could be very large. However, the problem states to use k = hash(...) %n +1. So even if it's n, but in ECDSA, k must be in 1..n-1. So perhaps the problem expects that the modulo operation is such that k is in 1..n. Wait, but if k =n, then when computing r, which is (kG).x mod n, but if k is n, then kG would be the point at infinity, which is invalid. So maybe the problem's formula for k is intended to be (hash(...) % (n-1)) +1, but the problem says %n +1. So perhaps there's a mistake here, but I have to follow the problem's instruction.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"k=hash(msg)%n+1\". So for example, if hash is 5, n=10, then k=5%10 +1=6. If hash is 9, then 9%10=9, +1=10, which is equal to n. But in ECDSA, k must be in [1, n-1]. So if k =n, then it's invalid. But perhaps the problem assumes that n is such that hash %n is in 0..n-1, so k is 1..n. But k must be less than n, so if k =n, then it's invalid. However, the problem says to use this formula regardless. So perhaps in the code, after computing k, we need to check if k >=n, but the problem statement doesn't mention that. Hmm. Wait, the problem says \"k=hash(msg)%n+1\". So hash(msg) is msg%1_000_003, then modulo n, then +1. So k = ( (msg % 1_000_003) % n ) + 1. So (msg % 1_000_003) % n is in 0..n-1, so k is 1..n. So if k ==n, then it's invalid. But ECDSA requires k to be in 1..n-1. So perhaps in that case, the signature would be invalid, but the problem says to use this k. So maybe we just proceed, and if k is n, then during signing, when computing r, it would be invalid.

Let me think. The problem is to find the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll, which means one envelope can fit into another only if both width and height are strictly larger.\n\nFirst, I remember that this is similar to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem, but with two dimensions. The standard approach is to sort the envelopes in a way that allows us to apply LIS on one dimension.\n\nWait, right. The trick here is to sort the envelopes by width in ascending order, and if two envelopes have the same width, sort their heights in descending order. Why descending? Because if we have the same width, we can't nest them (since width isn't strictly increasing), so by sorting heights in descending order, we prevent including multiple envelopes with the same width in the LIS, which would be invalid.\n\nOnce sorted, the problem reduces to finding the longest increasing subsequence based on height. Because after sorting by width, for any two envelopes where the width is increasing (and strictly when widths are different), we just need the heights to form an increasing sequence.\n\nWait, but when widths are the same, the heights are sorted in reverse, so when we process the heights, the LIS algorithm won't pick more than one from the same width group. For example, if two envelopes have the same width, their heights are ordered from high to low, so when looking for increasing heights, the next one can't be part of the same sequence.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Sort envelopes by width (ascending), and if same width, sort height descending.\n\n2. Extract the list of heights.\n\n3. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the height list.\n\nBut wait, how to compute LIS efficiently? The standard O(n^2) approach is too slow for large n, but there's an O(n log n) method using binary search.\n\nThe O(n log n) approach for LIS works by maintaining a list where each element is the smallest possible tail value for all increasing subsequences of a given length.\n\nSo for each height in the sorted list, we do:\n\n- If it's larger than the last element in the tails list, append it.\n\n- Else, find the first element in tails that is >= current height, and replace it with the current height.\n\nThis way, tails remains sorted, and the length of tails gives the LIS length.\n\nLet me test this with an example.\n\nExample: envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]\n\nSort them: first by width ascending. So sorted order would be [2,3], [5,4], [6,7], [6,4]. Wait, because for same width (6), height is sorted descending, so 7 comes before 4.\n\nHeights list: [3,4,7,4]\n\nNow find LIS of [3,4,7,4].\n\nProcessing:\n\n- 3: tails = [3]\n\n- 4: >3, append → [3,4]\n\n-7: append → [3,4,7]\n\n-4: find first >=4 in tails, which is 4 (at index 1), replace with 4. tails becomes [3,4,7] → no change. Wait, but 4 is equal to the current element. Wait, the tails list is [3,4,7]. The current element is 4. We need to find the first element >=4. That's 4. So replace it with 4. So tails becomes [3,4,7] → same as before. So the length remains 3.\n\nSo the maximum is 3. Which is correct: [2,3] → [5,4] → [6,7].\n\nAnother example: [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3]]. After sorting, widths are same, so heights sorted descending: [3,2,1]. LIS of heights is length 1, which is correct because all have same width.\n\nAnother example: [[2,3],[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[1,2]]. Wait, sorted by width: [1,2], [2,3], [5,4], [6,7], [6,4]. Heights: 2,3,4,7,4. LIS is 2,3,4,7 → length 4? Wait, but [1,2] → [2,3] → [5,4] → [6,7]. But 4 <7, but 5,4 to 6,7 is okay. Wait, the heights after sorting are [2,3,4,7,4]. The LIS would be 2,3,4,7 → length 4. So the answer is 4.\n\nWait, but the envelope [5,4] has height 4, which is less than 7. So that sequence is valid.\n\nYes. So the algorithm works.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort envelopes: key is (width, -height)\n\n- Extract heights\n\n- Compute LIS of the heights array using the O(n log n) method.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, sort the envelopes.\n\nenvelopes.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n\nThen, extract the height", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.17333333333333334, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 1764, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert max_envelopes([(5,4),(6,4),(6,7),(2,3)])==3"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem is: given a list of envelopes with (width, height), find the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested inside each other. An envelope can fit into another if both width and height are strictly larger.\n\nHmm, this reminds me of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. Because for nesting, each subsequent envelope must be larger in both dimensions. So if I can sort the envelopes in a way that allows me to apply LIS on one dimension, maybe.\n\nWait, right. The standard approach here is to sort the envelopes first. But how exactly?\n\nLet me recall. If we sort by width in ascending order, and if widths are equal, sort height in descending order. Why descending? Because if two envelopes have the same width, you can't nest them, so by sorting height descending, when we process the heights, those with same width won't form an increasing sequence, which prevents invalid nesting.\n\nFor example, if we have envelopes (2,3) and (2,4), after sorting, (2,4) comes before (2,3). Then when we take the heights array [4,3], the LIS of this would not include both, which is correct.\n\nOnce sorted, the problem reduces to finding the longest increasing subsequence on the heights. Because the widths are already sorted, so as long as the heights are increasing, the widths will also be non-decreasing (but since same widths are handled by the height sort), the actual valid sequences will have strictly increasing widths (because when widths are same, heights are decreasing, so they can't be part of the same LIS).\n\nWait, let me verify. Suppose after sorting, the widths are in order, so for two envelopes i and j where i < j, either width[i] < width[j], or width[i] == width[j] and height[i] >= height[j].\n\nSo when we take the height array, any increasing subsequence in heights will correspond to a sequence where each subsequent envelope has a larger width (since if width is same, the heights are in descending order, so you can't have two same widths in the LIS). Therefore, the LIS on the heights will give the correct maximum nesting.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Sort envelopes by width ascending, and if same width, height descending.\n\n2. Extract the heights into a list.\n\n3. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the heights list.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow, the LIS problem can be solved in O(n^2) with dynamic programming, but for larger n, we need O(n log n) using patience sorting.\n\nGiven that the problem might have a large number of envelopes (though the problem statement doesn't specify constraints), but as an engineer, I should implement the efficient version.\n\nWait, the problem says \"max_envelopes(envelopes:list[tuple[int,int]])->int\". So the function needs to return the maximum number.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, sort the envelopes. The key is lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]).\n\nThen, create a list of heights.\n\nThen compute LIS of that list.\n\nSo, for example, if envelopes are [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]], after sorting:\n\nsorted_envelopes = sorted(envelopes, key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n\nWhich would be [(2,3), (5,4), (6,7), (6,4)].\n\nHeights list is [3,4,7,4].\n\nThe LIS of [3,4,7,4] is [3,4,7] length 3, which is correct (the answer is 3).\n\nAnother example: if all widths are same, then after sorting, heights are in descending order, so LIS is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems valid.\n\nNow, implementing the LIS part with O(n log n).\n\nThe standard method is to maintain a list that represents the smallest possible tail for all increasing subsequences of length i+1.\n\nFor each number in the array:\n\n- If it's larger than the last element in the list, append it.\n\n- Else, find the first element in the list that is >= current number, and replace it with current number.\n\nAt the end, the length of the list is the length of the LIS.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef length_of_lis(nums):\n    tails = []\n    for num in nums:\n        # Find the position where num should be inserted\n        left, right = 0, len(tails)\n        while l", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.17333333333333334, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 1982, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert max_envelopes([(5,4),(6,4),(6,7),(2,3)])==3"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

Let me think about it. The problem is to find the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll, which means one envelope can fit into another only if both width and height are strictly larger.\n\nSo, given a list of envelopes with (width, height), I need to find the longest increasing subsequence where both dimensions are strictly increasing.\n\nHmm, I remember that this is similar to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem but with two dimensions. The standard approach for LIS is O(n^2) with dynamic programming, but for large n, that's not efficient. However, for this problem, there's a better approach.\n\nWait, the key idea here is to sort the envelopes first. How to sort them? If we sort by width in ascending order, and for the same width, sort height in descending order. Why descending? Because if two envelopes have the same width, you can't put one inside the other, so sorting height descending ensures that when we process the heights, the same width envelopes don't get counted in the LIS. Because if they were sorted ascending, the LIS might include multiple same-width envelopes, which is invalid.\n\nOnce sorted, the problem reduces to finding the LIS of the heights array. Because after sorting by width (and handling same widths correctly), the problem becomes finding the longest sequence where heights are strictly increasing. Because the widths are already sorted, so as long as the heights are increasing, the widths will be non-decreasing. But since same widths are sorted by height descending, any increasing sequence in heights will have strictly increasing widths (since same width ones have higher heights first, so they can't be part of the same sequence).\n\nWait, let me verify. Suppose we have envelopes sorted by width ascending, and for same width, height descending. So for example, if there's (2,3), (2,4), they would be sorted as (2,4), (2,3). Then, when we look at the heights array, it's [4,3]. The LIS here would be length 1, which is correct because you can't put (2,4) inside (2,3).\n\nSo by sorting same width heights in descending order, we ensure that only one envelope per width is considered in the LIS for heights.\n\nOnce sorted, the problem reduces to finding the LIS of the height array, but with the condition that it's strictly increasing. Because for the heights, we need each next height to be larger than the previous. Wait, but in the standard LIS problem, sometimes it's non-decreasing, but here it's strictly increasing.\n\nWait, the standard patience sorting algorithm for LIS finds the longest non-decreasing subsequence. But here, we need strictly increasing. So maybe we need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, in our case, after sorting the envelopes by width ascending and height descending, the heights array will have for same width, higher heights first. Then, when we process the heights, any valid sequence must have strictly increasing heights, which would correspond to strictly increasing widths (since widths are sorted ascending, but same widths are handled by the height sort).\n\nSo the problem becomes, given the heights array (after sorting), find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.\n\nWait, but how does the patience sorting work for strictly increasing? Let's think.\n\nThe standard algorithm for LIS (longest non-decreasing) uses a greedy approach where for each element, you find the first element in the 'tails' array that is >= current, and replace it. But for strictly increasing, we need the next element to be greater than the previous.\n\nWait, in our case, since the widths are sorted, and for same widths, heights are sorted descending, the heights array will have the property that if two elements have the same width, their heights are in descending order. So when we process the heights, any two elements with the same width cannot be part of the same increasing subsequence. Because their heights are in descending order, so you can't have both in the sequence.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the longest strictly increasing sub", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.0, "combined_score": 0.13333333333333333, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 2288, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert max_envelopes([(5,4),(6,4),(6,7),(2,3)])==3"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

Let me think.\n\nThe problem is to find the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested inside each other. Each envelope is a tuple of (width, height), and one envelope can fit into another only if both width and height are strictly larger.\n\nHmm, I remember that this is similar to the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. But since there are two dimensions, I need to sort them in a way that reduces it to a 1D problem.\n\nWait, right. The standard approach is to sort the envelopes by width in ascending order. But if two envelopes have the same width, how to handle them? Because you can't nest envelopes with the same width. So, for the same width, we should sort the heights in descending order. Why? Because if two have the same width, the one with larger height can't contain the smaller one, so by sorting heights descending, when we process the heights, we avoid including multiple envelopes with the same width in the LIS.\n\nFor example, if we have envelopes like (2,3), (2,4), if sorted by width ascending and height ascending, then the heights would be 3,4, which would form an increasing sequence, but since widths are same, they can't be nested. So by sorting heights descending, the heights would be 4,3, so the LIS in heights would not include both.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Sort envelopes: first by width ascending, then by height descending.\n\n2. Then find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) on the heights array. Because after sorting, the widths are non-decreasing, but since same widths are handled by height descending, the LIS in heights will ensure that both width and height are strictly increasing.\n\nWait, let's check. Suppose after sorting, the widths are in order, so for two envelopes i and j where i < j, width[i] <= width[j]. If width[i] < width[j], then for the height, if height[i] < height[j], then j can contain i. If width[i] == width[j], then since we sorted heights descending, height[i] >= height[j], so height[i] < height[j] is impossible. So in the sorted list, the only possible valid pairs for nesting are when i < j, width[i] < width[j], and height[i] < height[j]. Therefore, by taking the heights array after this sort, finding the LIS on heights will give the maximum number of envelopes that can be nested, because the widths are already non-decreasing, and the LIS ensures that each subsequent height is larger, which implies that the width must also be larger (since if width was equal, the height would be smaller or equal, so not part of the increasing sequence).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the LIS of the heights array after the correct sorting.\n\nNow, how to compute the LIS efficiently. The standard O(n^2) DP approach would be too slow for large n (like 1e4 elements), but the problem might expect the O(n log n) approach.\n\nThe O(n log n) method for LIS involves building a list where each element represents the smallest possible tail value for all increasing subsequences of a certain length. For each element in the array, we use binary search to find the position where this element can replace the current tail to potentially form a longer subsequence.\n\nSo the steps for the algorithm:\n\n- Sort the envelopes as (width ascending, height descending).\n- Extract the heights into a list.\n- Compute the LIS length of this heights list using the O(n log n) method.\n\nLet's test with an example.\n\nExample: envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]\n\nAfter sorting:\n\nFirst, sort by width: 2,5,6,6.\n\nFor width 6, sort heights descending: 7,4.\n\nSo sorted envelopes: (2,3), (5,4), (6,7), (6,4).\n\nHeights array: [3,4,7,4]\n\nNow find LIS of [3,4,7,4].\n\nThe LIS here is 3,4,7 (length 3), but wait, the correct maximum nesting is 3: (2,3) -> (5,4) -> (6,7).

The goal is to compute the maximum matching size.\n\nHopcroft-Karp is an efficient algorithm for this, especially for dense graphs.

Initialize matching for both sides (left and right) as -1 (unmatched).\n2. While there are augmenting paths:\n   a. Use BFS to build layers from unmatched left nodes, marking distances.\n   b.

Since the left nodes are 0..U-1 and right 0..V-1, we can create an adjacency list for the left nodes. So for each left node u, list all v such that (u, v) is in edges.\n\nThe algorithm maintains:\n- matchL: array of size U, where matchL[u] is the matched right node for u, or -1 if none.\n- matchR: array of size V, where matchR[v] is the matched left node for v, or -1 if none.\n\nThe steps:\n\n1. Initialize matchL and matchR with -1.\n\n2. While true:\n   a. Build a BFS tree starting from all unmatched left nodes. The distance array (dist) for left nodes is initialized. For each left node u not in matchL (i.e., matchL[u] == -1), set dist[u] = 0 and enqueue. Then, for each layer, process nodes by alternating between left and right.\n   \n   Wait, the BFS in Hopcroft-Karp is a bit specific. It builds layers where even layers are left nodes and odd are right. The BFS starts from free left nodes (distance 0), then for each left node u in the queue, look at all neighbors v. If v is not matched, then we've found an augmenting path (but need to check if it's the shortest). Wait, no: the BFS is used to compute the shortest distance from free left nodes to free right nodes.\n\n   The BFS steps:\n\n   - dist: array for left nodes (size U), initialized to infinity (or -1).

For right nodes, we can track their distance as well, but perhaps the key is for the left nodes.\n\n   Wait, the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm's BFS step:\n\n   Initialize a queue. For each u in U where matchL[u] == -1, set dist[u] = 0 and enqueue u.

I need to implement the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm to find the maximum bipartite matching size. The function takes U, V, and a list of edges. So the left set has U vertices (0 to U-1), right has V (0 to V-1), and edges are tuples connecting them.\n\nFirst, I remember that Hopcroft-Karp is an algorithm for finding maximum matchings in bipartite graphs. It's more efficient than the standard DFS approach for each node because it finds multiple augmenting paths in each iteration.\n\nThe algorithm works in phases. In each phase, it uses BFS to build layers of the graph, then uses DFS to find disjoint augmenting paths. Each phase increases the matching by as many paths as possible.\n\nLet me recall the steps:\n\n1. Initialize the matching for left and right vertices. Usually, we have matchL and matchR arrays where matchL[u] is the matched vertex in V for u in U, and similarly matchR[v] for v in V. Initially, all are set to -1 or None.\n\n2. While there are augmenting paths:\n   a. Use BFS starting from all free left nodes (those not in the current matching) to build a layered graph where each layer alternates between unmatched and matched edges.\n   b. Use DFS to find a maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest augmenting paths in this layered graph.\n   c. Augment the matching along these paths.\n\nThe key idea is that BFS builds the shortest augmenting paths, and DFS finds them in a way that avoids overlapping paths.\n\nLet me think about the data structures needed.\n\n- matchL: list of length U, matchL[u] = v if u is matched to v, else -1.\n- matchR: list of length V, matchR[v] = u if v is matched to u, else -1.\n\nFor BFS, we need to compute the distance (level) of each left node. The BFS starts from all free left nodes (those where matchL[u] is -1). The BFS alternates between unmatched edges (from U to V) and matched edges (from V to U).\n\nWait, the layered graph is built such that each layer alternates between unmatched and matched edges. So starting from free left nodes (layer 0), we go to their neighbors (via unmatched edges) to layer 1, then from those neighbors via matched edges (to the next layer), etc.\n\nIn the BFS, we assign distances (d) to each node in U. For nodes in V, maybe we track their distance as well, but perhaps it's handled implicitly.\n\nWait, the standard Hopcroft-Karp BFS:\n\n- Initialize a queue with all free left nodes (u where matchL[u] == -1), and set their distance to 0.\n- While queue not empty:\n   - Dequeue a left node u.\n   - For each neighbor v of u:\n      - If the edge (u, v) is not in the matching (but since we're building the layered graph for augmenting paths, maybe in the BFS we consider edges not in the matching from U to V, and edges in the matching from V to U), then we look at the next node.\n      - So for each v in adj[u], if the current matching for v is not set (but no, in the layered graph, from U to V we take unmatched edges. Wait, the augmenting path starts with an unmatched edge, then matched, etc.\n\nWait, in the BFS phase, we build a graph where edges from U to V are only those not in the current matching, and edges from V to U are only those in the current matching. Then the BFS is done on this directed graph.\n\nSo the BFS starts from all free U nodes (distance 0). Then, for each u in the queue, we look at all v adjacent to u via edges not in the matching (since the first edge of an augmenting path is unmatched). Then from v, we can go to the matched u' (if any), which is the node that v is currently matched to. So the BFS alternates between layers.\n\nThe BFS constructs layers where each layer k contains nodes at distance k from the start. The BFS stops when it reaches a free node in V (since that's the end of an augmenting path).\n\nWait, the BFS is used to find the shortest augmenting paths. The distance array (for left nodes) is used in the DFS to ensure that we only traverse edges that go to the next layer.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- BFS to compute distances (d) for left nodes.

The Grundy number (also known as the Nim-value) for a node is defined as the minimum excitation value that can be forced by playing optimally from that node. In graph games, we often have local strategies like \"Play all moves that leave no opponent's move open\" which can help determine the Grundy number.\n\nGiven the problem statement, we have:\n- A graph game with nodes 0 to n-1\n- Each node has a list of possible moves to other nodes\n- We need to find the Grundy number starting from node 0\n\nThe algorithm to solve this problem:\n1. For each node, calculate its Grundy number recursively.\n2. The Grundy number for a node is the minimum of the Grundy numbers of all reachable nodes (after all moves), considering all possible moves.\n3. The minimum excitation value is the smallest non-negative integer k such that at least one player has a move that results in a position with Grundy number k.\n\nWe can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently, avoiding redundant calculations.\n</think>\n\nFinal answer: <think>\nThe Sprague-Grundy theorem for graph games states that the Grundy number of a position is the minimum over all positions reachable from that position of the sum of their Grundy numbers, where positions are combined in nim-sum (exclusive or).\n\nFor our graph game, we can compute the Grundy number of node 0 by recursively calculating the Grundy numbers of all reachable nodes. The Grundy number of a node is the minimum of the Grundy numbers of all nodes reachable from that node, where reachable nodes are those that can be reached by any sequence of moves in the graph.\n\nThe key insight is that the Grundy number of a node depends only on the reachable nodes, not the original node. This allows us to use dynamic programming to compute the Grundy numbers of all nodes, building from the bottom up.\n\nHere's the Python code to compute the Grundy number:\n\n```python\ndef sprague_grundy_graph_game(n, moves):\n    # Initialize Grundy numbers for all nodes\n    grundy = [0] * n\n    \n    # Compute Grundy numbers for all nodes\n    for node in range(n):\n        # Get reachable nodes\n        reachable = set()\n        for next_node in moves[node]:\n            reachable.add(next_node)\n        \n        # Find minimum Grundy number of reachable nodes\n        grundy[node] = min(grundy[r] for r in reachable)\n    \n    return grundy[0]\n```\n\nThis solution uses dynamic programming to compute the Grundy numbers for all nodes, starting from node 0. The base case is when a node has no reachable nodes (in which case its Grundy number is 0).\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, as we potentially need to check all reachable nodes for each node.\n</think>\n\nFinal answer: {\"final_answer\": \"I will code the Sprague-Grundy theorem for graph games using dynamic programming to compute the Grundy numbers for all nodes, building from the bottom up.\"}", "score": 0.05, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 483, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert sprague_grundy_graph_game(3,[[1,2],[2],[]])==1"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

For example, if the sequence is [1,2,3] and we have a 6-sided die, we want to know how many rolls we expect to make to see this sequence in any order.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. For any sequence, we need to see each number in the sequence appear at least once.\n2. The expected rolls for each number can be calculated using the formula:\n   (1/(sides) + 1/(sides) +... + 1/(sides)) * rolls_required\n   Where rolls_required is the number of rolls needed to see that specific number at least once.\n3. Since we don't care about the order of the numbers in the sequence, we can use the Aho-Corasick algorithm to find the shortest path to the end state.\n4. The DP approach would involve calculating the expected number of rolls for each subsequence.\n\nLet's start with the base case. For a sequence of length 1, the expected number of rolls is 1. For a sequence of length 2, it's 2*1/(sides) (since we need to see each number at least once).\n\nFor a sequence of length 3, we have two scenarios:\na. We see both numbers in the first two rolls, and then in the third roll, we see the third number.\nb. We see one of the numbers in the first two rolls, and then we need to roll again to see the next number.\n\nThe Aho-Corasick algorithm can help us find the shortest path to the end state, which would be the minimum number of rolls required to see the entire sequence.\n\nFor the DP approach, we would need to define a state that represents the number of consecutive numbers we've seen so far and the number of rolls required to reach that state. The transition function would then calculate the expected number of rolls for each state.\n\nHere's a possible solution using the DP approach:\n\n```python\ndef expected_rolls_to_get_sequence(seq, sides):\n    n = len(seq)\n    # Initialize a dictionary to store the expected rolls for each subsequence\n    dp = {}\n    \n    # Base case: expected rolls for a subsequence of length 1\n    for num in seq:\n        dp[f\"{num}\"] = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the expected rolls for all possible subsequences\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(i):\n            current_subseq = seq[j:i]\n            expected_rolls = dp[current_subseq]\n            \n            # Calculate the expected rolls for the current subsequence\n            # We need to see each number in the subsequence at least once\n            for num in seq[j:i]:\n                expected_rolls += 1/(sides)\n            \n            dp[current_subseq] = expected_rolls\n    \n    # Return the expected rolls for the entire sequence\n    return dp[f\"{' '.join(map(str, seq))}\"]\n```\n\nThis solution uses a dictionary to store the expected rolls for each subsequence, and then iteratively calculates the expected rolls for all possible subsequences. The final answer is the expected rolls for the entire sequence.\n\nThe Aho-Corasick algorithm can help us find the shortest path to the end state, which would be the minimum number of rolls required to see the entire sequence. However, since we're calculating the expected rolls for all possible subsequences, the Aho-Corasick algorithm is not directly applicable in this case.\n\nFinal answer: The expected rolls to see the sequence as consecutive outcomes is the minimum number of rolls required to see the entire sequence, which can be calculated using the DP approach described above.\n</think>\n\nFor the expected number of rolls to see a sequence of consecutive numbers as outcomes, we can use the Aho-Corasick algorithm with dynamic programming.

The mex of a set of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.\n\nSince the graph is a DAG, there are no cycles, so we can process the nodes in topological order. That way, when we calculate the Grundy number for a node, all its next nodes (which are in the direction of the edges) have already been processed.\n\nWait, but topological order for a DAG is such that for every directed edge u → v, u comes before v in the ordering. But in our case, the moves[u] are the next nodes, so edges go from u to moves[u][i]. So to compute the Grundy number for u, we need the Grundy numbers of all v in moves[u]. Therefore, we need to process the nodes in reverse topological order. Because if u has edges to v, then v must be processed before u. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a node u that has edges to v1, v2, etc. To compute grundy[u], we need grundy[v1], grundy[v2], etc. So the dependencies are that u depends on its children (the nodes it can move to). Therefore, we need to process the nodes in an order where all children are processed before the parent. Which is the reverse of the topological order. Alternatively, topological sort gives an order where all parents come before children. Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nIn a topological sort, the order is such that for every edge u → v, u comes before v. So if u has an edge to v, then u is before v. But in our case, when calculating grundy[u], we need the grundy numbers of v (since u can move to v). So if u is processed before v, then when we process u, v hasn't been processed yet. That's a problem. So we need to process v before u. Therefore, the correct order is the reverse topological order. So we need to process nodes starting from the ones with no outgoing edges (sinks), then their predecessors, etc.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute the topological order of the DAG. But since the graph might not be connected, but it's a DAG, so we can still get a topological order.\n\nWait, but how do we get the reverse topological order? Alternatively, we can process nodes in order of increasing distance from the sinks. For example, sinks (nodes with no outgoing edges) have grundy number 0, because mex of empty set is 0.\n\nWait, no. The mex of an empty set is 0, yes. So for a sink node (no moves), grundy[u] = 0.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each node, compute the mex of the grundy numbers of its next nodes.\n\nBut since the graph is a DAG, we can process the nodes in reverse topological order (so that all children are processed before the parent).\n\nSo first, we need to find the topological order, then reverse it, and process nodes in that reversed order.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the in-degrees for the reversed graph. Wait, perhaps a better way is to process nodes starting from the sinks.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an array grundy of size n, with -1 (unprocessed).\n\n2. For each node, we need to know when all its next nodes have been processed. So perhaps a better approach is to use memoization with recursion, but since it's a DAG, recursion with memoization would work, but for large n, iterative is better.\n\nAlternatively, compute the topological order. Let's see:\n\nCompute the in-degree of each node in the original graph. Wait, no. Wait, the standard topological sort uses the in-degree in the original graph. But we need to process nodes in reverse order.\n\nWait, here's the plan:\n\nWe need to process each node after all its neighbors (the nodes it can move to) have been processed.

Since it's a DAG, there are no cycles, so we can process nodes in topological order. But how do I handle the topological sort here?\n\nWait, the graph might not be a single path; it could have multiple branches. The key is that for each node u, all its neighbors (moves[u]) must be processed before u. So the correct approach is to process nodes in reverse topological order. Wait, no. Let's think: the Grundy number of a node depends on the Grundy numbers of its next nodes. So for node u, we need to compute mex of the Grundy numbers of all v in moves[u]. Therefore, we need to process the nodes in an order where all v (successors) are processed before u. That means processing nodes in reverse topological order. Because in topological order, all dependencies (predecessors) come before, but here we need successors to be processed first. So perhaps a topological sort from sinks (nodes with no outgoing edges) backwards.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a DAG, we can process nodes in topological order, but starting from the end. Wait, let me recall: topological order is such that for every directed edge u → v, u comes before v. So if we process nodes in reverse topological order, then for each node u, all its successors (v) would have been processed already. Because in the topological order, u comes before v, so reverse order would have v before u. Wait, no. Let's say the topological order is [0, 1, 2], where 0 → 1 → 2. Then reverse order is [2,1,0]. So processing 2 first (which has no outgoing edges, so its Grundy number is 0), then 1, which points to 2 (already processed), then 0, which points to 1 (processed). So yes, processing in reverse topological order ensures that when we compute the Grundy number for u, all its moves (v) have already been computed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the topological order of the graph.\n2. Process nodes in reverse topological order.\n3. For each node u, collect the Grundy numbers of all v in moves[u], then compute mex of those values.\n4. The Grundy number for node 0 is the result.\n\nBut how to get the topological order? Well, since it's a DAG, we can perform a topological sort. However, the problem states that the graph is a DAG, so we don't have to check for cycles.\n\nWait, but the input may not have all nodes connected. So the topological sort needs to include all nodes from 0 to n-1.\n\nAnother approach: since it's a DAG, we can use memoization with recursion, but for large n, recursion might hit stack limits. Alternatively, process nodes in an order where each node is processed after all its descendants. Which is exactly reverse topological order.\n\nSo first, let's find the topological order. To get topological order, one common method is to use Kahn's algorithm (BFS-based) or DFS-based.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is given as moves, which for each node u lists the next nodes, perhaps we can compute the in-degrees for each node. Wait, for Kahn's algorithm, we need in-degrees.\n\nWait, but in our case, to process in reverse topological order, maybe it's easier to reverse the edges. Because the reverse topological order of the original graph is the topological order of the reversed graph.\n\nWait, let's think: in the original graph, a topological order is such that all edges go from earlier to later. So in reverse topological order, edges go from later to earlier. So if we reverse all edges, then a topological order of the reversed graph would be the reverse of the original topological order.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to process nodes in the order of increasing distance from sinks.

That way, when we process a node, all its reachable nodes (which come after it in the topological order) have already been processed. Wait, no. Wait, in a DAG, edges go from a node to others. So for a node u, the moves[u] are the nodes it can move to. So when calculating the Grundy number for u, we need the Grundy numbers of all nodes in moves[u]. Therefore, if we process the nodes in reverse topological order (starting from the leaves), then when we get to u, all its children (moves[u]) have already been processed. Wait, but topological order is such that all edges go from earlier to later nodes. So reverse topological order would have edges going from later to earlier. Hmm, maybe I need to process the nodes in topological order but in reverse.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a topological sort of the graph, which is a linear ordering where for every directed edge u → v, u comes before v. So in topological order, all predecessors of a node come before it. Wait, no: in topological order, u comes before v if there's an edge u → v. So when processing in topological order, when we get to node v, all nodes u that have edges to v have already been processed. But in our case, for node u, we need the Grundy numbers of its neighbors (v in moves[u]), which are the nodes u can move to. So for node u, the moves[u] are the children. So when processing u, we need the Grundy numbers of its children. Therefore, if the children are processed before u, then we can compute u's Grundy number. But in topological order, u comes before its children, which is the opposite. So perhaps we need to process the nodes in reverse topological order. That way, the children (which come after u in topological order) are processed before u in reverse order.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the correct approach is to process the nodes in reverse topological order. For each node u, collect the Grundy numbers of all its children (moves[u]), compute mex of those, and assign it to u.\n\nBut how do we get the reverse topological order? One way is to perform a topological sort (like using Kahn's algorithm), then reverse the order.\n\nWait, but how to handle the graph structure here. The input is n and moves, where moves[u] is the list of next nodes from u. So the graph is given as an adjacency list.\n\nFirst step: compute a topological order of the graph. Since it's a DAG, topological sort is possible.\n\nWait, but how to get the topological order. Let's think. We can use Kahn's algorithm, which works by repeatedly removing nodes with in-degree zero.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is given as outgoing edges (moves[u] are the neighbors), we can compute the in-degrees for each node.

I need to define a function called sprague_grundy_graph_game that takes an integer n and a list of lists called moves. The function should return the Grundy number for the starting node 0 in a DAG game.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Sprague-Grundy theorem applies to impartial games under the normal play convention. Each position in such a game can be assigned a Grundy number, which is the mex (minimum excludant) of the Grundy numbers of the positions reachable in one move.\n\nSince it's a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), there are no cycles, so we can process the nodes in topological order. That way, when we compute the Grundy number for a node, all its reachable nodes (the ones it can move to) have already been processed.\n\nThe steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Determine the topological order of the nodes. But wait, how do I get the topological order here? The graph is given as moves, where moves[u] is the list of next nodes from u. So the graph has edges from u to each v in moves[u].\n\nBut to compute the topological order, I need to know the in-degrees or process the nodes in reverse. Alternatively, since it's a DAG, we can process nodes in reverse topological order (from leaves up to the start node). Wait, actually, the mex for a node depends on the Grundy numbers of its neighbors. So if a node u has moves to v1, v2, ..., vk, then the Grundy number of u is mex of the Grundy numbers of v1, v2, etc.\n\nTherefore, to compute the Grundy number for u, we need to have already computed the Grundy numbers for all v in moves[u]. That means we should process the nodes in reverse topological order. Wait, no. Let me think. If the graph is a DAG, then there's a topological order where all edges go from earlier to later in the order. Wait, no. In a topological sort, all edges go from nodes earlier in the order to later ones. Wait, no, actually, the topological order is such that for every directed edge u → v, u comes before v in the ordering. So if we process the nodes in reverse topological order (starting from the end), then when we process a node u, all its neighbors (v's) have already been processed. Wait, no. If the topological order is u1, u2, ..., un, then edges go from ui to uj where i < j. So when processing in reverse order (from un down to u1), when we get to ui, all uj with j > i (which are the nodes reachable from ui) have already been processed. Therefore, processing in reverse topological order allows us to compute the Grundy numbers correctly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the topological order of the graph.\n- Process the nodes in reverse topological order.\n- For each node, collect the Grundy numbers of its neighbors (moves[u]).\n- Compute mex of those numbers.\n- Store the Grundy number for the node.\n\nBut wait, the starting node is 0. So node 0 is part of the graph. We need to compute the Grundy number for node 0.\n\nFirst, how to get the topological order? Since the graph is a DAG, we can perform a topological sort. However, the graph may not be connected, but since it's a DAG, each node is part of some component.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to process nodes in an order where all dependencies (the nodes they move to) are processed first. Which is exactly the reverse topological order.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is a DAG, we can compute the Grundy numbers using memoization, but for efficiency, processing in reverse topological order is better.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the topological sort here? Let's think: the graph is given as moves, where for each node u, moves[u] is the list of next nodes. So edges are u → v for each v in moves[u].\n\nTo get the topological order, we can compute the in-degree of each node. But perhaps for the purpose of processing in reverse topological order, we can do a topological sort first.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is a DAG, we can process nodes in the order of increasing depth, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: since each node's Grundy number depends on the nodes it can move to, which are its children in the graph.

Wait, \"abcb\" has \"bcb\" as a subsequence which is length 3.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum length of such a subsequence.\n\nI remember that dynamic programming is often used for this kind of problem.

Get the length of the string, n.\n2. Create a 2D DP array of size n x n, initialized to 0.\n3. Set all dp[i][i] = 1 since single characters are palindromes of length 1.\n4.

So 0 + 2 = 2. So dp[0][1] = 2.\n\nSimilarly, for i=1, j=2: 'b' and 'b' → same, so dp[1][2] = 2.\n\nWait, maybe the example works.\n\nBut how about the case when s[i] != s[j], like in \"abc\".\n\nFor \"abc\", the LPS is 1 (any single char), but let's see:\n\nn=3.\n\ndp[0][2] would be max(dp[1][2], dp[0][1]).\n\ndp[1][2] for \"bc\" → max between dp[2][2] (1) and dp[1][1] (1) → 1.\n\ndp[0][1] for \"ab\" → max( dp[1][1]=1, dp[0][0]=1 ) → 1.\n\nSo dp[0][2] = 1.

But dp[1][0] is 0 (since i>j), so 0+2=2.\n\ni=1, j=2: 'b' and 'b' → same. dp[1][2] = dp[2][1] (0) +2 → 2.\n\ni=2, j=3: 'b' and 'a' → different.

Let's see. A palindromic subsequence is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards, but the characters don't have to be consecutive in the original string.\n\nHmm, dynamic programming is probably the way to go here. I remember that for problems like longest common subsequence (LCS), DP is used. Wait, the longest palindromic subsequence can be thought of as the LCS of the string and its reverse. Because a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, so the LCS between s and reverse(s) should give the longest palindromic subsequence.\n\nLet me verify that. For example, take \"bbbab\". The reverse is \"babbb\". The LCS of these two is \"bbbb\", which has length 4. And the longest palindromic subsequence of \"bbbab\" is indeed 4 (like \"bbbb\"). Another example: \"cbbd\" reversed is \"dbbc\". The LCS is \"bb\", length 2, which matches the expected result. So this approach seems valid.\n\nSo the plan is: reverse the string, compute the LCS between s and its reverse. The length of that LCS is the answer.\n\nNow, how to compute LCS with DP. The standard DP approach for LCS uses a 2D table where dp[i][j] is the length of LCS of s1[0..i-1] and s2[0..j-1].\n\nThe recurrence is:\n- If i == 0 or j == 0: dp[i][j] = 0\n- If s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1\n- Else: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n\nSo for this problem, s2 is the reversed s.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the function:\n\n1.

The value at dp[len(s)][len(s)] is the answer.\n\nWait, but using a full 2D table might be memory-intensive for very long strings, but given that the problem doesn't specify constraints, and Python can handle it for reasonable lengths, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nExample 1: s = \"bbbab\"\nrev_s = \"babbb\"\nLCS is 4. So the function should return 4.\n\nExample 2: s = \"cbbd\"\nrev_s = \"dbbc\"\nLCS is \"bb\", so 2.\n\nAnother example: s = \"a\", rev_s = \"a\", LCS is 1.\n\nEdge case: s = \"\", returns 0.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\ndef longest_palindromic_subsequence(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    rev = s[::-1]\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, n+1):\n            if s[i-1] == rev[j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n    \n    return dp[n][n]\n\nWait, but this uses O(n^2) time and space. For the problem statement, this should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, there's a more space-efficient way by using two rows instead of the entire table, but the problem says to provide the minimal correct solution, so the straightforward 2D DP is acceptable.\n\nLet me check if there's another approach. For example, another DP approach specific to palindromic subsequences. The standard approach for longest palindromic subsequence is to use a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in s[i..j].\n\nThe recurrence would be:\n- If i == j: 1\n- If i > j: 0\n- If s[i] == s[j]: dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]\n- Else: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n\nThis approach also uses O(n^2) time and space, but perhaps this is more direct. Let's see which is better.\n\nFor example, for s = \"bbbab\", the DP table would be filled for all i <= j.\n\nBut which approach is easier to implement? The LCS approach requires reversing the string and then computing LCS, which is a standard problem. The direct approach requires handling the i and j indices correctly.\n\nBut both approaches are valid. Let's see which one is more efficient. The LCS approach would have the same time complexity, but the direct approach might have a slightly smaller constant factor since it's tailored to the problem.\n\nWait, but the problem says to provide the minimal correct solution.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, what's a palindromic subsequence? A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. So the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) is the longest such sequence that's a palindrome.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"bbbab\", the LPS is \"bbbb\" with length 4. Another example: \"cbbd\" has LPS \"bb\" with length 2.\n\nHow do I compute this efficiently? I remember that dynamic programming is often used for these kinds of problems. Let's think about the DP approach.\n\nThe idea is that for a string s, the LPS can be found by considering the first and last characters. If they are the same, then the LPS length is 2 plus the LPS of the substring in between. If they are different, then it's the maximum of the LPS of the substring excluding the first character or excluding the last character.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation would be:\n\nIf s[i] == s[j], then LPS(i, j) = 2 + LPS(i+1, j-1)\nElse, LPS(i, j) = max(LPS(i+1, j), LPS(i, j-1))\n\nBase cases: when i == j, LPS is 1 (single character). When i > j, LPS is 0.\n\nThis looks like a standard DP problem. The problem is similar to the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem, but here we're comparing the string with its reverse. Wait, another approach: the LPS of s is equal to the LCS of s and its reverse. Because a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, so the longest subsequence that is common between s and reverse(s) would be the LPS.\n\nBut maybe implementing the DP directly is more straightforward.\n\nLet's consider the DP table approach. Let's create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the LPS for the substring s[i..j].\n\nWe can fill this table diagonally. Starting with substrings of length 1 (all 1s), then length 2, etc.\n\nFor example, for a string of length n:\n\nInitialize a dp table of size n x n.\n\nFor all i from 0 to n-1:\n    dp[i][i] = 1\n\nThen for lengths l from 2 to n:\n    for i from 0 to n - l:\n        j = i + l - 1\n        if s[i] == s[j]:\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2\n        else:\n            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n\nWait, but when l=2, j = i+1. So for \"aa\", s[i] == s[j], then dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]. But i+1 is j, which is i+1, and j-1 is i, so i+1 > j-1, so dp[i+1][j-1] is 0. Hence, 2 + 0 = 2, which is correct.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nLet's test this with \"bbbab\" (length 5).\n\nIndices 0-4.\n\nInitialize dp with 1s on the diagonal.\n\nNow for l=2:\n\ni=0, j=1: s[0] = 'b', s[1] = 'b' → equal. dp[0][1] = 2 + dp[1][0] = 2 + 0 = 2.\n\ni=1, j=2: 'b' vs 'b' → 2.\n\ni=2, j=3: 'b' vs 'a' → max(dp[3][3], dp[2][2]) → max(1,1) = 1.\n\ni=3, j=4: 'a' vs 'b' → max(1,1) =1.\n\nThen l=3:\n\ni=0, j=2: s[0]='b', s[2]='b' → equal. dp[0][2] = 2 + dp[1][1] = 2 +1=3.\n\ni=1, j=3: 'b' vs 'a' → max(dp[2][3]=1, dp[1][2]=2) → 2.\n\ni=2, j=4: 'b' vs 'b' → 2 + dp[3][3] = 2+1=3.\n\nl=4:\n\ni=0, j=3: s[0]='b', s[3]='a' → max(dp[1][3]=2, dp[0][2]=3) → 3.\n\ni=1, j=4: s[1]='b', s[4]='b' → 2 + dp[2][3] = 2 +1=3.\n\nl=5:\n\ni=0, j=4: s[0]='b', s[4]='b' → equal. So 2 + dp[1][3] (which is 2) → 4. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the final dp[0][4] is 4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: \"cbbd\".\n\nn=4.\n\ndp table:\n\nAfter initialization (diagonal 1s):\n\nl=2:\n\ni=0, j=1: 'c' vs 'b' → max(1,1) →1.\n\ni=1, j=2: 'b' vs 'b' → 2.\n\ni=2, j=3: 'b' vs 'd' →1.\n\nl=3:\n\ni=0, j=2: 'c' vs 'b' → max(dp[1][2]=2, dp[0][1]=1) →2.\n\ni=1, j=3: 'b' vs 'd' → max(dp[2][3]=1, dp[1][2]=2) →2.\n\nl=4:\n\ni=0, j=3: 'c' vs 'd' → max(dp[1][3]=2, dp[0][2]=2) →2.\n\nSo the answer is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo the DP approach seems to work.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe can create a 2D list for dp.

Since a single character is a palindrome of length 1, dp[i][i] = 1.\n\nFor the case where i < j:\n- If the characters at positions i and j are the same, then we can add 2 to the result of the subsequence from i+1 to j-1. So dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2.\n- If they are different, then the longest subsequence would be the maximum of either excluding the character at i (so dp[i+1][j]) or excluding the character at j (dp[i][j-1]).\n\nWait, but how do we fill the DP table? Since the subproblems depend on smaller substrings, we need to iterate in a way that when computing dp[i][j], the required smaller subproblems are already solved.\n\nSo, perhaps we can iterate the length of the substring from 1 to n (the length of s), and for each possible starting index i, compute j = i + length - 1.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1.

For example, if s is \"aa\", then i=0, j=1. s[0] == s[1], so dp[0][1] = dp[1][0] + 2. Wait, dp[i+1][j-1] when i+1 > j-1 would be 0? Because if i=0, j=1, then i+1 = 1, j-1 =0, which is invalid. So for cases where i > j, the value is 0.\n\nWait, in the case where the substring length is 2, like \"aa\", then s[0] and s[1] are equal. So dp[i][j] = 2 (since dp[1][0] is 0, so 0 + 2 = 2). That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: \"ab\". Since s[0] != s[1], dp[0][1] = max(dp[1][1], dp[0][0]) = 1.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the DP approach seems correct.\n\nLet me test with a sample input. Take \"babad\".\n\nThe longest palindromic subsequence length is 3.\n\nLet's compute it step by step.\n\nn = 5.\n\nInitialize dp as 5x5 zeros.\n\nSet all dp[i][i] = 1.\n\nNow for length 2:\n\nCheck all substrings of length 2.\n\nFor i=0, j=1: \"ba\". s[0] != s[1], so dp[0][1] = max(dp[1][1], dp[0][0]) = 1.\n\ni=1, j=2: \"ab\". same, dp[1][2] =1.\n\ni=2, j=3: \"ba\", same as first, 1.\n\ni=3, j=4: \"ad\", same, 1.\n\nLength 3:\n\nFor i=0, j=2 (\"bab\"):\n\ns[0] = 'b', s[2] = 'b' → equal. So dp[0][2] = dp[1][1] +2 =1+2=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for i=1, j=3 (\"aba\"):\n\ns[1] = 'a', s[3] = 'a' → equal. dp[1][3] = dp[2][2] +2 =1+2=3.\n\nSo that's another possible subsequence.\n\nThen for length 4 and 5.\n\nContinuing, but perhaps the code will handle it.\n\nSo the code should correctly compute dp[0][4] as 3.\n\nAnother test case: \"cbbd\".\n\nThe longest palindromic subsequence is \"bb\", length 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=4.\n\ndp[0][0] =1, dp[1][1]=1, etc.\n\nFor length 2:\n\ni=0, j=1: 'c' and 'b' → max(1,1) →1.\n\ni=1, j=2: 'b' and 'b' → 2.\n\ni=2, j=3: 'b' and 'd' →1.\n\nLength 3:\n\ni=0, j=2: 'c' vs 'b' → no. dp[0][2] = max(dp[1][2], dp[0][1]) = max(2,1) →2.\n\ni=1, j=3: 'b' vs 'd' → max(dp[2][3]=1, dp[1][2]=2) →2.\n\nLength 4:\n\ni=0, j=3: 'c' vs 'd' → max(dp[1][3]=2, dp[0][2]=2) →2.\n\nSo the answer is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the DP approach works.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe can create a 2D list, but since Python has lists of lists, but for efficiency, perhaps using a list of lists.\n\nBut for n up to, say, 1000, this w", "length_tokens": 1622}

Let me recall how Newton's method works. The basic idea is to iteratively update the current point x using the inverse of the Hessian multiplied by the gradient. But sometimes the step might be too big, so backtracking line search is used to find a suitable step size that satisfies the Armijo condition.\n\nFirst, the function signature is newton_backtracking_line_search(f, grad, hess, x0) where f is the objective function, grad is the gradient, hess is the Hessian, and x0 is the initial point as a list of floats.\n\nThe main steps for Newton's method with backtracking:\n\n1. Compute the Newton direction: d = -H^{-1} * g, where H is the Hessian and g is the gradient at current x.\n\nBut wait, for 2D, the Hessian is a 2x2 matrix. So I need to solve H * d = -g for d. Since it's convex, the Hessian should be positive definite, so the inverse exists (or at least the system is solvable).\n\n2. Then, perform backtracking line search to find the step size t. Start with t = 1, and reduce it by a factor beta (like 0.5) until the Armijo condition is met.\n\nArmijo condition: f(x + t*d) <= f(x) + c * t * grad(f, x)^T * d\n\nWhere c is a constant, typically 0.1 or 0.01.\n\nWait, but since d is the Newton direction, which is a descent direction (because H is positive definite), the dot product of grad and d should be negative. So the Armijo condition ensures sufficient decrease.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nWhile not converged:\n\n   Compute gradient g and Hessian H at current x.\n\n   Solve H * d = -g for d (Newton direction)\n\n   If the norm of d is very small, stop (converged)\n\n   Set t = 1\n\n   While f(x + t*d) > f(x) + c * t * (g^T d):\n\n        t = beta * t\n\n   x = x + t*d\n\nBut need to choose parameters c and beta. Common choices are c=1e-4, beta=0.5.\n\nNow, for the implementation in Python.\n\nFirst, since x0 is a list of floats, we'll convert it to a numpy array for easier manipulation, but the problem says \"minimal correct solution\" and maybe they want it without numpy? Wait, the user says \"include ONE final Python code block\", but the problem is for 2D, so maybe using numpy is acceptable, but the question says \"minimal\". However, since it's 2D, perhaps we can do matrix inversion manually.\n\nWait, the Hessian is 2x2. So for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, c]], the inverse is (1/(ac - b²)) * [[c, -b], [-b, a]].\n\nSo maybe to avoid numpy, we can compute the inverse directly.\n\nBut the problem says \"careful engineer\", so maybe better to handle the inversion carefully.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nGiven x as a list (or array), compute grad and hess at x.\n\nCompute the Newton direction d.\n\nBut for 2D, hess is a 2x2 matrix. Let's say hess returns a list of lists, like [[h11, h12], [h21, h22]]. Since it's symmetric (for convex functions), h12 = h21.\n\nSo to invert the Hessian:\n\ndet = h11*h22 - h12*h21\n\nIf det is zero (but for convex function, it's positive definite, so det >0), so inverse is [[h22, -h12], [-h21, h11]] / det.\n\nSo d = - inverse_hess * grad.\n\nWait, the Newton step is d = - H^{-1} g.\n\nSo for 2D:\n\ng = [g1, g2]\n\nH_inv = 1/det * [[h22, -h12], [-h21, h11]]\n\nSo d_x = (- (h22 * g1 - h12 * g2 )) / det\n\nd_y = (- (-h21 * g1 + h11 * g2 )) / det\n\nWait, let's compute H^{-1} * g:\n\n[ (h22 * g1 - h12 * g2)/det , (-h21 * g1 + h11 * g2)/det ]\n\nThen multiply by -1 for the direction.\n\nSo d = [ - (h22*g1 - h12*g2)/det , - (-h21*g1 + h11*g2)/det ]\n\nBut since H is symmetric, h12 = h21, so:\n\nd_x = (-h22 * g1 + h12 * g2)/det\n\nd_y = (h12 * g1 - h11 * g2)/det\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nH = [[a, b], [b, c]]\n\nH^{-1} = 1/(ac - b²) * [[c, -b], [-b, a]]\n\nSo H^{-1} * g = [ (c*g1 - b*g2)/det , (-b*g1 + a*g2)/det ]\n\nThen d = - H^{-1} * g = [ (-c*g1 + b*g2)/det , (b*g1 - a*g2)/det ]\n\nYes.

Let me think through the steps.\n\nFirst, Newton's method typically uses the formula x_{k+1} = x_k - [Hessian]^{-1} * gradient. But sometimes the step might be too large, so we use a line search to find a better step size. The backtracking line search starts with a step size (like alpha=1) and reduces it until the Armijo condition is satisfied.\n\nArmijo condition: f(x_k + alpha * d) <= f(x_k) + c * alpha * grad(f)(x_k)^T d, where d is the search direction. Here, d is the Newton direction, which is -Hessian^{-1} * gradient. For convex functions, the Hessian should be positive definite, so the direction should be a descent direction.\n\nWait, but in Newton's method, the search direction d = -Hessian^{-1} grad. So grad^T d should be negative (since Hessian is positive definite, so d is a descent direction). Therefore, the Armijo condition checks if the function decreases sufficiently.\n\nThe parameters for backtracking usually include c (like 0.5) and a reduction factor (like 0.5). Start with alpha=1, check if the condition holds. If not, multiply alpha by the factor (e.g., 0.5) and check again until it does.\n\nSo the steps for the line search part:\n\n1. Compute the Newton direction d = -inv(H) * grad.\n2. Set alpha = 1.\n3. While f(x + alpha*d) > f(x) + c * alpha * grad^T d:\n   a. alpha = alpha * beta (beta is like 0.5)\n4. Return x + alpha*d as the next iterate.\n\nBut wait, for convex functions, the Hessian is positive definite, so the Newton direction is a descent direction, which ensures that for small enough alpha, the Armijo condition will be satisfied.\n\nNow, the function to implement is newton_backtracking_line_search(f, grad, hess, x0) which returns the next point.\n\nWait, the problem says \"improve Newton with Armijo backtracking for small 2D convex f\". So the function should take f (the function), grad (gradient function), hess (Hessian function), and x0 (initial point as list of floats). The output is the next point after one iteration with backtracking.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Implement newton_backtracking_line_search(f,grad,hess,x0:list[float])->list[float]\". So the function is supposed to perform one step of Newton with backtracking, returning the new x.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is to implement the line search part as part of Newton's method. So given x0, compute the Newton step with backtracking to get x1.\n\nSo steps in the function:\n\n1. Compute gradient at x0: g = grad(x0)\n2. Compute Hessian at x0: H = hess(x0)\n3. Solve H * d = -g for d (since Newton direction is d = -H^{-1} g)\n   But in 2D, H is a 2x2 matrix. So we can compute the inverse or solve the linear system.\n4. Compute the search direction d.\n5. Then perform backtracking line search to find alpha.\n6. Return x0 + alpha*d.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"improve Newton with Armijo backtracking\". So the standard Newton step is x0 + d (with alpha=1), but if that doesn't satisfy Armijo, we backtrack.\n\nNow, the Armijo condition: f(x0 + alpha*d) <= f(x0) + c * alpha * (grad(x0) · d)\n\nBecause grad(x0) · d is the directional derivative in direction d.\n\nSince d is the Newton direction, which for convex functions is a descent direction, so grad · d < 0.\n\nParameters for backtracking: need to choose c (usually 1e-4) and beta (like 0.5). The problem doesn't specify, so I should use standard values.\n\nSo in code:\n\n- c = 0.5 (maybe 0.1 or 0.5; sometimes 0.5 is used for Armijo)\nWait, common choice is c=1e-4, but maybe the problem expects a typical value.

The states are 0, 1, ..., n, where state i means the last i characters match the first i characters of seq. We start at state 0, and we want to reach state n.\n\nFor each state i (from 0 to n-1), when we roll the die, we get a new character (number) x. We need to determine the next state j, which is the length of the longest prefix of seq that matches the suffix of the current sequence (which is the previous i characters plus x).\n\nThis is similar to the KMP failure function. For each position i in the sequence, we can precompute the longest proper suffix which is also a prefix. This helps in determining, when a mismatch occurs, how much of the prefix we can keep.\n\nWait, but in this case, since we're building the next state based on adding a new character, for each state i and possible roll x, we can compute the next state. For example, if we're in state i and we roll x, then the next state is the largest j such that the first j characters of seq match the last j characters of (seq[0..i-1] + x).\n\nSo the key is to precompute for each state i and each possible x, what the next state j is. Then, using dynamic programming, we can set up equations for E[i], the expected number of rolls needed to reach state n from state i.\n\nThe base case is E[n] = 0, since we're already done. For other states, E[i] = 1 + sum over all possible x (probability of x * E[next_state(i, x)]).\n\nBut since each roll is independent and each face has probability 1/sides, for each state i, we can compute the expected value based on transitions.\n\nNow, the challenge is efficiently computing the next_state(i, x) for each i and x. This is where the Aho-Corasick automaton comes in, but for a single pattern, it's equivalent to the KMP failure function.\n\nLet me think. For the sequence seq, we can build a transition table. For each state i (current match length), and for each possible next character x, the next state is:\n\n- If x == seq[i], then next state is i+1.\n- Else, we look for the longest proper suffix of seq[0..i-1] + x that matches a prefix of seq. Wait, no. Actually, when we have a current match of length i, and we add x, if x is not seq[i], then we need to find the largest k < i such that the first k characters of seq match the last k characters of (seq[0..i-1] + x). But since the current sequence before adding x was seq[0..i-1], adding x gives a new sequence of length i+1, but we only care about the suffix that matches the prefix of the target.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the failure function from KMP. The failure function (or prefix function) for position i is the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix for the substring seq[0..i].\n\nWait, but here, when we are in state i (meaning the last i characters match the first i of the target), and we roll a new character x. If x equals seq[i], then we move to state i+1. If not, we need to ", "length_tokens": 2382}

I need to find the expected number of rolls to get a specific sequence of numbers when rolling a die with 'sides' sides. The sequence is given as a list of integers, 'seq'. The problem mentions using an Aho-Corasick automaton with dynamic programming. Hmm, I remember that the Aho-Corasick algorithm is used for string matching, building a trie with failure links. But how does that apply here for expected rolls?\n\nWait, the problem is similar to the classic \"expected number of trials to see a specific sequence\" problem. Like the expected number of coin flips to get \"HHH\" or something. For that, people often use states representing the current suffix of the sequence matched so far, and set up equations based on transitions between states.\n\nOh right! The standard approach for these problems is to model it as a Markov chain where each state represents the length of the current matching prefix of the target sequence. Then, using dynamic programming, we can compute the expected number of steps to reach the absorbing state (the full sequence).\n\nBut how do we handle overlaps in the sequence? For example, if the target is \"ABAB\", then after failing at the fourth character (if we get something other than B), maybe the suffix \"AB\" could still match the start of the sequence. So the failure links in Aho-Corasick help find the longest proper suffix which is also a prefix. That's exactly what we need here for the state transitions when a mismatch occurs.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Build a trie (or a state machine) where each state corresponds to the length of the current matching prefix (from 0 up to len(seq)).\n2. For each state i (current matched length), and for each possible die roll (1 to sides), determine the next state j. If the roll matches seq[i], then j = i+1. If not, we need to find the largest k < i such that the first k characters of seq match the suffix of the current string (after adding the new roll). This k is the next state.\n3. Using dynamic programming, let E[i] be the expected number of additional rolls needed to reach the end from state i. Our goal is E[0].\n4. The recurrence is E[i] = 1 + sum_{possible outcomes} (probability of outcome * E[next_state]).\n5. For the absorbing state (i = len(seq)), E[i] = 0.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the next state when there's a mismatch? For example, suppose the current state is i, and we roll a number that doesn't match seq[i]. Then we need to backtrack to the longest possible prefix that is a suffix of the current sequence plus the new roll.\n\nThis is where the failure function (like in KMP) comes in. For each position i in the sequence, we precompute the longest proper suffix which is also a prefix. For example, for the sequence [1,2,1,2], when at state 4 (fully matched), but if we're at state 3 (matched first three elements: 1,2,1) and the next roll is not 2, then we need to see what's the longest prefix that matches the new suffix.\n\nWait, maybe the standard KMP prefix function (pi array) can be used here. The pi array for position i gives the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix for the substring seq[0..i].\n\nSo, for each state i (0-based, current matched length), when we process a new character c:\n\n- If c == seq[i], then next state is i+1.\n- Else, we look for the largest k < i such that seq[0..k-1] is a suffix of seq[0..i-1] + [c]. But how to compute this efficiently?\n\nWait, in KMP, the failure function for position i is the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix for seq[0..i]. So when there's a mismatch at position i (i.e., after matching i characters, the next character doesn't match seq[i]), we set i = pi[i-1], and check again.\n\nBut in our case, when we are in state i (have matched i characters), and the next roll is c. If c equals seq[i], we go to i+1. If not, we need to find the largest k such that the first k characters of seq match the last k characters of (the previous i characters + c). So the new state is k.\n\nThis is exactly what the KMP failure function helps with. For example, for the sequence [a,b,a,b], if we're in stat", "length_tokens": 2281}

Hmm, I remember that the Aho-Corasick algorithm is used for string matching, building a trie with failure links. But how does that relate to expected values here?\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to the problem of finding the expected number of trials to get a specific pattern in a sequence of independent trials. For example, the classic problem of flipping a coin until you get \"HH\" or \"HT\". In those cases, you set up states based on the current suffix of the observed sequence that matches a prefix of the target.\n\nSo for a given target sequence, you can model the problem as a Markov chain where each state represents the length of the current matching prefix. When you roll a new number, you transition to the next state based on how much the new sequence matches the target.\n\nFor instance, if the target is [1,2,3], then the states are 0 (no match), 1 (matched first element), 2 (matched first two), and 3 (done). The expected number of steps from state 0 is what we need.\n\nThe approach would involve setting up equations for the expected number of steps from each state. Let E[k] be the expected number of additional rolls needed to reach the end when currently in state k (having matched the first k elements of the sequence).\n\nThe base case is E[n] = 0, where n is the length of the sequence.\n\nFor each state k < n, when we roll the next number, there's a 1/sides chance for each possible outcome. Depending on the outcome, we might transition to a new state. If the next number matches the (k+1)th element of the sequence, we go to state k+1. Otherwise, we might fall back to a previous state based on the longest proper suffix which is also a prefix (like the failure function in KMP).\n\nWait, so this is similar to the KMP algorithm's failure function. For each state k, we need to know, for each possible next character c, what's the next state. The next state would be the length of the longest prefix of the target that matches the suffix of the current sequence plus c.\n\nFor example, if the target is [a, b, c], and current state is 2 (so we've matched [a,b]), and the next roll is d. If d is not c, then we look for the longest prefix that matches the suffix of [a,b,d]. The suffix here would be [b,d], but since d isn't c, maybe the longest prefix is 0 or 1? Wait, depends on the target.\n\nSo for each state k and each possible next symbol, we compute the next state m, which is the length of the longest prefix of the target that is a suffix of (target[0:k] + [c]). This m can be precomputed using the KMP failure function.\n\nTherefore, for each state k, the expected value E[k] satisfies:\n\nE[k] = 1 + (1/sides) * sum_{c=1 to sides} E[ next_state(k, c) ]\n\nBut since some transitions might lead to the same next state, we can group them.\n\nWait, but for the specific next symbol that matches the target[k], we transition to k+1. For other symbols, we transition to some m < k+1.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nE[k] = 1 + (1/sides) * [ E[k+1] + sum_{c != target[k]} E[ m(k, c) ] ]\n\nBut how do we compute m(k, c) for each c?\n\nThis is where the KMP failure function comes into play. For each position k in the target sequence, and for each possible character c, we can determine the next state.\n\nWait, but the standard KMP failure function gives the longest prefix which is also a suffix for the substring up to k. However, when we have a mismatch at position k (i.e., after matching k characters, the next character is c which doesn't match target[k]), the next state is determined by the failure function.\n\nBut in our case, for each possible c (including the correct one), we need to find the next state.

For example, if the sequence is [1,2,3], then states could be 0 (no match), 1 (matched first element), 2 (matched first two), 3 (matched all, which is the absorbing state). The expected number of steps to reach state 3 from state 0 is what we need.\n\nBut how do the transitions work? Let's think. Suppose we're in state i, meaning we've matched the first i characters of the sequence. When we roll the next number, say x, we check if x equals the (i+1)th character of the sequence. If yes, we go to state i+1. If not, we need to find the longest possible suffix of the current string (which is the matched part plus x) that matches a prefix of the target sequence. That's where the failure function from Aho-Corasick comes in. So for each state i and possible roll x, we determine the next state j, which could be i+1 if x matches, or some j < i based on overlaps.\n\nSo the DP state would be E[i], the expected number of additional rolls needed to reach the end from state i. Our goal is E[0]. The base case is E[n] = 0, where n is the length of the sequence.\n\nFor each state i < n, when we roll the die, there's a 1/sides chance for each outcome.

This k is determined by the failure function of the Aho-Corasick automaton.\n\nWait, but how do we compute k for each i and x? Maybe we can precompute a transition table. Let's consider the sequence as a string, and build a KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) failure function, which is similar. The KMP prefix function gives for each position i the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix for the substring up to i.\n\nBut in this problem, when we are at state i (having matched the first i characters), and we read a new character x, if x is not seq[i], we need to find the largest k such that the prefix of length k matches the suffix of the current string (which is the first i characters plus x). Wait, the current string would be seq[0..i-1] + [x]. So we need the longest k where seq[0..k-1] == (seq[0..i-1] + x)[i - k + 1 ... i].\n\nThis is similar to the KMP failure function, but the failure function for KMP is for when there's a mismatch at position i. Wait, perhaps the transition for state i on input x is given by the KMP automaton's transition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each state i (current match length), and each possible die face x, the next state j is the length of the longest prefix of seq that is a suffix of (current prefix + x). So for example, if seq is [1,2,1], and current state is 2 (we've matched [1,2]), and we roll a 1, then the new string is [1,2,1], which matches the full sequence, so j=3. But if we roll a 2 instead, the new string is [1,2,2]. The longest prefix that is a suffix here would be length 0, because the suffix '22' doesn't match the start of [1,2,1]. Wait, no: the current prefix is [1,2], adding 2 gives [1,2,2]. The possible prefixes to check are:\n\nCheck if the entire [1,2,2] ends with seq[0..k-1] for k=3: seq[0..2] is [1,2,1], which doesn't match [1,2,2], so k=3 no.\n\nk=2: seq[0..1] is [1,2]. The last two elements of [1,2,2] are [2,2], which doesn't match [1,2], so no.\n\nk=1: seq[0] is 1. The last element is 2, which doesn't match 1. So k=0.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a longer match.

For large n, this could be slow. But maybe for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.

For each row, if we precompute the minimum value and the second minimum, then for each column j in the next row, if the previous row's minimum was at column j, then we take the second minimum; otherwise, take the minimum.\n\nAh, that's a common technique in DP problems where you need the min of all except the current index.\n\nSo, for each row i-1, we can store:\n\n- min_val: the minimum dp value in the row\n- min_idx: the index where this minimum occurs\n- second_min: the second minimum value in the row\n\nThen, for row i, when computing dp[i][j], if the previous row's min was at index j, then we have to use second_min; otherwise, use min_val.\n\nThis would allow us to compute each dp[i][j] in O(1) time per element, leading to O(m*n) time overall.\n\nYes, that's a good approach. Let's see.\n\nLet's work through an example.\n\nSuppose previous row's dp is [1, 2, 3]. Then min_val is 1 (index 0), second_min is 2.\n\nFor the next row, when j=0, we can't take the previous min (since it's at index 0), so we take second_min (2). For j=1 and j=2, we can take min_val (1).\n\nAnother example: previous dp is [3, 1, 1]. Then min_val is 1, but there are two indices (1 and 2) with value 1. So second_min is also 1. So for any j, if previous min is at j, but since there are multiple mins, even if j is one of them, the second_min is same as min, so we can take min_val. Wait, no. Wait, in this case, for j=1, the previous row's min_val is 1 (at index 1 and 2). So when we are at j=1 in the current row, the previous row's min_val could be taken from index 2 (which is allowed, since 2 !=1). So the min for previous row excluding j=1 is min(3, 1) (but wait, previous row is [3,1,1]. So excluding j=1, the values are 3 and 1 (index 0 and 2). The min is 1. So in this case, even though min_val is 1, and the current j is 1, there's another index (2) with the same value, so the min excluding j is still 1.\n\nAh, so the second_min approach works only if the minimum is unique.

I need to define a function called min_falling_path_sum_no_adjacent_col that takes a matrix of integers and returns the minimum sum. The rules are: choose one element per row, and adjacent rows can't use the same column.\n\nHmm, so for each row, I pick a column, but the next row can't pick the same column as the previous one. Wait, no—the problem says \"adjacent rows cannot use same column\". So if row i is in column j, then row i+1 can't be in column j. So consecutive rows must have different columns.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"adjacent rows cannot use same column\". So yes, for any two consecutive rows, their selected columns must be different.\n\nSo the task is to find a path from top to bottom where each step (row to next row) doesn't stay in the same column, and the sum of the elements is minimized.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem. Let's think.\n\nFor each row, and for each possible column, we can track the minimum sum to reach that cell, considering the constraints.\n\nLet's say dp[i][j] is the minimum sum to reach row i, column j.\n\nFor the first row (i=0), dp[0][j] = mat[0][j], since there's no previous row.\n\nFor subsequent rows (i >= 1), dp[i][j] = mat[i][j] + min of all dp[i-1][k] where k != j.\n\nWait, because the previous row (i-1) can't have the same column j. So for each j in row i, we look at all columns k in row i-1 where k is not equal to j, take the minimum of those dp values, and add mat[i][j].\n\nSo the recurrence is dp[i][j] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][k] for k != j)\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum value in the last row of dp.\n\nLet's test this with a small example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nmat = [\n  [1,2,3],\n  [4,5,6],\n  [7,8,9]\n]\n\nFirst row: dp[0] = [1,2,3]\n\nSecond row:\n\nFor j=0: min of dp[0][1], dp[0][2] → min(2,3)=2 → 4+2=6\n\nj=1: min(1,3) =1 →5+1=6\n\nj=2: min(1,2)=1 →6+1=7\n\nSo dp[1] = [6,6,7]\n\nThird row:\n\nFor j=0: min of dp[1][1], dp[1][2] → min(6,7)=6 →7+6=13\n\nj=1: min(6,7)=6 →8+6=14\n\nj=2: min(6,6)=6 →9+6=15\n\nSo dp[2] = [13,14,15], min is 13.\n\nBut wait, let's check the path: row0 col0 (1), row1 col1 (5), row2 col0 (7). Wait no, row2 can't be same as row1. Wait row1 is col1 (5), row2 can't be col1, so for row2 col0, it's allowed. So 1+5+7=13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: if the matrix is 2x2.\n\nmat = [[1,2],[3,4]]\n\nFirst row: [1,2]\n\nSecond row:\n\nj=0: min of dp[0][1] = 2 →3+2=5\n\nj=1: min of dp[0][0] =1 →4+1=5\n\nSo min sum is 5.\n\nWhich corresponds to 1+4 or 2+3, both sum 5. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nFor each row after the first, for each column j, we need to find the minimum of the previous row's dp except for j.\n\nIf we do this naively, for each j, iterate through all k != j in previous row, take min. For an n x m matrix, that's O(n*m^2) time.\n\nBut maybe we can optimize this.\n\nFor the previous row, if we precompute the minimum value and the second minimum, then for each j, if the previous row's minimum is at a column not equal to j, then we can take the minimum. Otherwise, take the second minimum.\n\nWait, but the columns are ordered. Let's think.\n\nSuppose in the previous row (i-1), the minimum value is min_val, and it occurs at index min_idx. The second minimum is second_min, occurring at any other index.\n\nThen, for the current row's column j:\n\nif j != min_idx, then the minimum possible value from previous row is min_val.\n\nelse, we have to take second_min.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple indices with the same min_val? For example, previous row has [2, 1, 1], min_val is 1, min_idx could be 1 and 2.\n\nIn that case, if current j is 1, then min_val from previous row (excluding j=1) would be 1 (from index 2). So even if min_val occurs at multiple places, as long as there's another index with min_val, then for j equal to one of the min_idx, the min is still min_val.\n\nWait, no. Suppose previous row is [1,1,2]. min_val is 1, occurs at 0 and 1.\n\nFor current j=0: we need to take min of previous row's k !=0 → which is min(1,2) →1.\n\nSimilarly for j=1: min of previous row's k !=1 → min(1,2) →1.\n\nSo in th", "length_tokens": 2177}

I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum falling path sum in a matrix, but with a twist: adjacent rows can't use the same column. Wait, the problem says \"adjacent rows cannot use same column\". So when moving from one row to the next, the column has to be different. But wait, the problem statement says \"choose one element per row; adjacent rows cannot use same column.\" Oh, right, so for each consecutive pair of rows, the columns selected must not be the same.\n\nSo the task is to pick one element from each row such that no two consecutive rows have the same column, and the sum of all selected elements is minimized.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. This sounds like a dynamic programming problem. Because for each row, the choice of column affects the next row's possible choices.\n\nLet me consider the example. Suppose the matrix is:\n\nrow 0: [a, b, c]\nrow 1: [d, e, f]\nrow 2: [g, h, i]\n\nFor row 0, the possible choices are a, b, c. For row 1, if I chose column 0 (a) in row 0, then in row 1 I can't choose column 0 again. So for each position in row 1, the minimum sum up to that point would be the minimum of the sums from the previous row's columns except the same column.\n\nWait, so for each cell (i, j), the value would be the minimum of the previous row's cells where the column is not j, plus mat[i][j].\n\nSo the DP state could be dp[i][j] = minimum sum up to row i, column j.\n\nThe recurrence would be dp[i][j] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][k] for all k != j)\n\nThe base case is the first row: dp[0][j] = mat[0][j]\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of dp[last row][j] for all j.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test this logic with a small example.\n\nTake a 2x2 matrix:\n\nmat = [\n  [1, 2],\n  [3, 4]\n]\n\nFor row 0, dp[0][0] = 1, dp[0][1] = 2.\n\nFor row 1, column 0: must take min of previous row's columns except 0. So only column 1, which is 2. So dp[1][0] = 3 + 2 =5.\n\nSimilarly, dp[1][1] = 4 + 1 =5.\n\nThe minimum sum is 5.\n\nWhich is correct: 1+4 or 2+3, both sum to 5.\n\nAnother example. Let's take 3x3:\n\nmat = [\n  [1,2,3],\n  [4,5,6],\n  [7,8,9]\n]\n\nRow 0: [1,2,3]\n\nRow 1: for each column:\n\ncol 0: min of row0 col1 and col2 → min(2,3) → 2. So 4 +2=6\n\ncol1: min of row0 col0 and col2 → min(1,3) →1 →5+1=6\n\ncol2: min of row0 col0 and col1 →1 →6+1=7\n\nSo row1: [6,6,7]\n\nRow2:\n\ncol0: min of row1 col1 and col2 → min(6,7) →6 →7+6=13\n\ncol1: min of row1 col0 and col2 → min(6,7) →6 →8+6=14\n\ncol2: min of row1 col0 and col1 →6 →9+6=15\n\nMinimum sum is 13. Which would be 1 (row0 col0) →5 (row1 col1) →7 (row2 col0). Wait, but adjacent rows can't have same column. So row0 col0, row1 col1 (different), row2 col0 (different from row1 col1). So that's allowed. Sum 1+5+7=13.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the DP approach seems valid.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nFor each row after the first, for each column j, we need the minimum of the previous row's dp values except for j.\n\nIf the matrix is m rows x n columns, then for each row, each column, we need to find the min of the previous row's elements except the same column.\n\nBut if we do this naively, for each j, loop through all k != j in previous row, it's O(n^2) per row, leading to O(mn^2) time. For large n, this could be slow, but perhaps acceptable for small n. However, the problem doesn't specify constraints, so we should look for an optimized way.\n\nWait, for each row, we can precompute the minimum value of the previous row, but need to handle cases where the current column is the one where the min is.\n\nFor example, suppose the previous row's minimum is at index k. Then, for the current row's column j, if j != k, then the min of previous row excluding j is the same as the global min. But if j == k, then we need the second smallest value in the previous row.\n\nAh, right. So for each row, we can compute the minimum and the second minimum. Then, for each j in current row:\n\nif previous row's min was at a column different from j, then use the min. Otherwise, use the second min.\n\nWait, more precisely: For the previous row's dp array, let min1 be ", "length_tokens": 2315}

For each unit of flow, find the shortest path (in terms of cost) from s to t in the residual graph, and send flow along that path. But for small F, this might be manageable. Wait, but F could be up to the total capacity, but since the graph is small, maybe this approach is feasible.\n\nWait, the Successive Shortest Path algorithm uses Bellman-Ford to find the shortest path in the residual network with respect to the reduced costs.

For each edge (u, v, cap, cost), the residual graph has forward edge with capacity = original cap - flow, cost = cost, and backward edge with capacity = flow, cost = -cost.\n\n- We'll represent the residual graph as an adjacency list where for each node, we have a list of (neighbor, residual_cap, cost, rev_index).

If it does, then it's impossible (unless T is X itself, but then it's trivial).\n\nSo for the case where term1 is a variable and term2 is some term, the substitution would be {term1: term2}, but only if term1 does not occur in term2 (occurs check).\n\nSimilarly, if term2 is a variable and term1 is a term, then {term2: term1}, but check occurs.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\n- If both are variables:\n   - If they are the same, return empty substitution.\n   - Else, create a substitution mapping the first to the second, but check if the first variable occurs in the second term. Wait, no. Wait, if term1 is a variable, say X, and term2 is a variable Y, then the substitution would be X -> Y. But occurs check here would check if X is in Y. But Y is a variable, so X is in Y only if Y is X. But since they are different variables, X is not in Y, so occurs check passes. Wait, but if X and Y are the same variable, then they are already equal, so no substitution needed.\n\nWait, maybe for two variables, the substitution is safe as long as they are not the same. Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose term1 is ?x and term2 is ?y. Then substituting ?x with ?y is allowed, and there's no occurs check issue because ?y does not contain ?x (assuming ?x and ?y are distinct variables). So occurs check is only when substituting a variable with a compound term that contains the variable.\n\nWait, occurs check is specifically for when the term being substituted into a variable contains that variable. So for example, if we have X = f(X), that's invalid because X occurs in f(X).\n\nSo in the case where term1 is a variable and term2 is a compound term, we need to check if term1", "length_tokens": 2457}

The terms can be variables (starting with '?'), constants, or functors like f(args...). Also, I must include an occurs check.\n\nFirst, let me recall how unification works. Unification finds a substitution that makes two terms identical. Variables can be replaced by terms, but we have to avoid cyclic substitutions (occurs check), which means a variable can't be substituted with a term that contains itself.\n\nThe steps for unification are usually:\n\n1. If term1 and term2 are the same, return empty substitution.\n2. If term1 is a variable, bind it to term2 (after occurs check).\n3. If term2 is a variable, bind it to term1 (after occurs check).\n4. If both are compound terms (functors), check if they have the same functor name and same number of arguments, then recursively unify each argument.\n\nWait, in Prolog-style unification, variables are represented as symbols starting with uppercase, but here variables start with '?', so maybe they are strings like '?x'.\n\nSo, terms can be:\n\n- Variables: strings where the first character is '?', e.g., '?x'\n- Constants: strings that don't start with '?', like 'a' or '5'\n- Functors: tuples where the first element is the functor name (a string), and the rest are arguments. For example, ('f', 'a', '?x') represents f(a, ?x).\n\nWait, the problem says \"terms built from variables (strings starting with '?'), constants, and functors f(args...)\". So how are the terms structured in Python?\n\nHmm, the problem statement is a bit vague on the exact representation. But in typical implementations, compound terms (functors) are represented as tuples where the first element is the functor symbol, followed by the arguments. For example, f(a, b) would be ('f', 'a', 'b'). Variables are strings like '?x', and constants are strings like 'a'.\n\nSo, the input terms can be:\n\n- A string (either variable starting with '?' or constant)\n- A tuple (functor with arguments)\n\nSo, the function needs to handle these cases.\n\nLet me outline the algorithm:\n\nThe unification function will take two terms and a substitution (as a dictionary), and recursively apply substitutions while checking for occurs.\n\nBut since the problem says to return a dict or None, maybe it's better to have a helper function that accumulates the substitution.\n\nWait, standard unification algorithm uses a substitution set, and applies substitutions as it goes.\n\nThe steps:\n\nBase cases:\n\n- If term1 == term2, return substitution (but maybe they are already substituted)\nWait, but we need to apply existing substitutions first.\n\nWait, the standard algorithm is:\n\n1. Apply the current substitution to both terms.\n2. Then, check the cases.\n\nWait, maybe the algorithm is:\n\nWe maintain a substitution set. Initially empty.\n\nAt each step, take the first equation (term1 = term2), apply current substitution, then:\n\n- If term1 and term2 are identical, do nothing.\n- If term1 is a variable, and not in term2 (occurs check), add {term1: term2} to substitution and apply to all equations.\n- Similarly for term2 being a variable.\n- If both are compound terms with same functor and arity, add equations for each argument.\n- Else, fail.\n\nBut implementing this as a recursive function with a substitution accumulator.\n\nAlternatively, the Martelli-Montanari algorithm, which processes a set of equations.\n\nBut for the purpose of writing a function, perhaps a recursive approach with substitution.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"unification_first_order(term1, term2) -> dict | None\"\n\nSo, given two terms, return the most general unifier as a dict, or None.\n\nLet me think of how to structure the code.\n\nFirst, need to handle variables, constants, and functors.\n\nSo, for each term, check its type.\n\nCase 1: Both terms are the same variable or constant. Return empty substitution.\n\nWait, but variables are strings starting with '?', constants are other strings.\n\nWait, if term1 and term2 are both strings:\n\n- If they ", "length_tokens": 2340}

The terms can be variables (strings starting with '?'), constants, or functors with arguments. Also, occurs check is required.\n\nFirst, let's recall what unification is. Unification finds a substitution that makes two terms identical. The substitution replaces variables with terms. The occurs check ensures that a variable isn't substituted with a term containing itself, which would lead to infinite recursion.\n\nThe input terms can be:\n- Variables: strings like '?x'\n- Constants: strings not starting with '?' (assuming all non-variable strings are constants)\n- Functors: like 'f(a, b)', but in the problem statement, they are built as f(args...), so probably represented as tuples where the first element is the functor name and the rest are arguments. Wait, but how are the terms structured in Python?\n\nWait, the problem says \"terms built from variables (strings starting with '?'), constants, and functors f(args...)\". So perhaps the terms are represented as nested structures. For example, a functor 'f' with arguments 'a' and 'g(b)' would be represented as ('f', 'a', ('g', 'b')).\n\nBut the problem statement isn't explicit on the data structure. Wait, in Prolog, terms are atoms, variables, or compound terms. Here, in Python, the terms are probably represented as follows:\n- Variables: strings starting with '?', e.g., '?x'\n- Constants: strings not starting with '?', e.g., 'a', 'b'\n- Functors: tuples where the first element is the functor name (a string), followed by the arguments. For example, f(a, b) would be ('f', 'a', 'b').\n\nWait, but maybe the functors are represented as lists or tuples. The problem statement says \"functors f(args...)\", so in code, perhaps the term is a tuple where the first element is the functor name and the rest are the arguments. For example, f(a, g(b)) would be ('f', 'a', ('g', 'b')).\n\nSo, the possible term types are:\n- If it's a string starting with '?', it's a variable.\n- If it's a string not starting with '?', it's a constant.\n- If it's a tuple (or list), then the first element is the functor name, and the rest are the arguments.\n\nWait, but constants could also be numbers or other types? The problem says \"constants\" but probably in this context, all constants are strings not starting with '?'. So, variables are strings with '?', others (strings, numbers, etc.) are constants? Hmm, but the problem statement says \"strings starting with '?'\" for variables, so maybe all terms are strings or tuples. Wait, perhaps all terms are either:\n- Strings: if starts with '?', variable; else, constant.\n- Tuples: functors, where the first element is the functor name (a string), followed by the arguments (terms).\n\nWait, but maybe the functor name is a string, and the arguments are terms. So, for example, the term f(a, X) would be represented as ('f', 'a', '?x').\n\nSo, in Python terms, the data structure is:\n- Variable: str starting with '?'\n- Constant: str not starting with '?'\n- Functor: tuple where the first element is a str (functor name), followed by terms (args).\n\nWait, but maybe the functor is represented as a list? But the problem says \"functors f(args...)\", so in code, perhaps as a tuple.\n\nNow, the unification algorithm steps:\n\n1. If term1 and term2 are identical, return empty substitution.\n2. If term1 is a variable, apply occurs check and then bind it to term2.\n3. If term2 is a variable, similarly.\n4. If both are functors, check if they have the same functor name and same number of arguments. Then unify each pair of arguments recursively.\n5. If none of the above, unification fails.\n\nBut we need to handle substitutions correctly, applying them to terms as we go.\n\nWait, the standard unification algorithm uses a substitution set, and applies substitutions to terms during unification.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\nWe maintain a substitution (a dictionary mapping variables to terms). Initially empty.\n\nBut the standard algorithm works by recursivel", "length_tokens": 2408}

The function should return the Grundy number for the starting node 0 in a DAG where moves[u] gives the list of next nodes from node u.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Grundy number (or mex function) for a node in an impartial game is the minimum excludant of the Grundy numbers of its reachable positions. The mex of a set of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.\n\nSince the graph is a DAG, there are no cycles, so we can process the nodes in topological order. That way, when we calculate the Grundy number for a node, all its next nodes (which are in the direction of the edges) have already been processed.\n\nWait, but topological order for a DAG is such that for every directed edge u → v, u comes before v in the ordering. But in our case, the moves[u] are the next nodes, so edges go from u to moves[u][i]. So to compute the Grundy number for u, we need the Grundy numbers of all v in moves[u]. Therefore, we need to process the nodes in reverse topological order. Because if u has edges to v, then v must be processed before u. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a node u that has edges to v1, v2, etc. To compute grundy[u], we need grundy[v1], grundy[v2], etc. So the dependencies are that u depends on its children (the nodes it can move to). Therefore, we need to process the nodes in an order where all children are processed before the parent. Which is the reverse of the topological order. Alternatively, topological sort gives an order where all parents come before children. Wait, no. Let's clarify.\n\nIn a topological sort, the order is such that for every edge u → v, u comes before v. So if u has an edge to v, then u is before v. But in our case, when calculating grundy[u], we need the grundy numbers of v (since u can move to v). So if u is processed before v, then when we process u, v hasn't been processed yet. That's a problem. So we need to process v before u. Therefore, the correct order is the reverse topological order. So we need to process nodes starting from the ones with no outgoing edges (sinks), then their predecessors, etc.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute the topological order of the DAG. But since the graph might not be connected, but it's a DAG, so we can still get a topological order.\n\nWait, but how do we get the reverse topological order? Alternatively, we can process nodes in order of increasing distance from the sinks. For example, sinks (nodes with no outgoing edges) have grundy number 0, because mex of empty set is 0.\n\nWait, no. The mex of an empty set is 0, yes. So for a sink node (no moves), grundy[u] = 0.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each node, compute the mex of the grundy numbers of its next nodes.\n\nBut since the graph is a DAG, we can process the nodes in reverse topological order (so that all children are processed before the parent).\n\nSo first, we need to find the topological order, then reverse it, and process nodes in that reversed order.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the in-degrees for the reversed graph. Wait, perhaps a better way is to process nodes starting from the sinks.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize an array grundy of size n, with -1 (unprocessed).\n\n2. For each node, we need to know when all its next nodes have been processed. So perhaps a better approach is to use memoization with recursion, but since it's a DAG, recursion with memoization would work, but for large n, iterative is better.\n\nAlternatively, compute the topological order.

Since it's a DAG, there are no cycles, so we can process nodes in topological order. But how do I handle the topological sort here?\n\nWait, the graph might not be a single path; it could have multiple branches. The key is that for each node u, all its neighbors (moves[u]) must be processed before u. So the correct approach is to process nodes in reverse topological order. Wait, no. Let's think: the Grundy number of a node depends on the Grundy numbers of its next nodes. So for node u, we need to compute mex of the Grundy numbers of all v in moves[u]. Therefore, we need to process the nodes in an order where all v (successors) are processed before u. That means processing nodes in reverse topological order. Because in topological order, all dependencies (predecessors) come before, but here we need successors to be processed first. So perhaps a topological sort from sinks (nodes with no outgoing edges) backwards.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a DAG, we can process nodes in topological order, but starting from the end. Wait, let me recall: topological order is such that for every directed edge u → v, u comes before v. So if we process nodes in reverse topological order, then for each node u, all its successors (v) would have been processed already. Because in the topological order, u comes before v, so reverse order would have v before u. Wait, no. Let's say the topological order is [0, 1, 2], where 0 → 1 → 2. Then reverse order is [2,1,0]. So processing 2 first (which has no outgoing edges, so its Grundy number is 0), then 1, which points to 2 (already processed), then 0, which points to 1 (processed). So yes, processing in reverse topological order ensures that when we compute the Grundy number for u, all its moves (v) have already been computed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the topological order of the graph.\n2. Process nodes in reverse topological order.\n3. For each node u, collect the Grundy numbers of all v in moves[u], then compute mex of those values.\n4. The Grundy number for node 0 is the result.\n\nBut how to get the topological order? Well, since it's a DAG, we can perform a topological sort. However, the problem states that the graph is a DAG, so we don't have to check for cycles.\n\nWait, but the input may not have all nodes connected. So the topological sort needs to include all nodes from 0 to n-1.\n\nAnother approach: since it's a DAG, we can use memoization with recursion, but for large n, recursion might hit stack limits. Alternatively, process nodes in an order where each node is processed after all its descendants. Which is exactly reverse topological order.\n\nSo first, let's find the topological order. To get topological order, one common method is to use Kahn's algorithm (BFS-based) or DFS-based.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is given as moves, which for each node u lists the next nodes, perhaps we can compute the in-degrees for each node. Wait, for Kahn's algorithm, we need in-degrees.\n\nWait, but in our case, to process in reverse topological order, maybe it's easier to reverse the edges. Because the reverse topological order of the original graph is the topological order of the reversed graph.\n\nWait, let's think: in the original graph, a topological order is such that all edges go from earlier to later. So in reverse topological order, edges go from later to earlier. So if we reverse all edges, then a topological order of the reversed graph would be the reverse of the original topological order.\n\nBut perhaps an easier way is to process nodes in the order of increasing distance from sinks.

Since it's a DAG, there are no cycles, so we can process the nodes in topological order. Wait, but how to handle the dependencies here? Because the Grundy number of a node depends on the Grundy numbers of its neighbors.\n\nRight, the standard approach for such problems is to compute the Grundy numbers in reverse topological order. That way, when we process a node, all its reachable nodes (which come after it in the topological order) have already been processed. Wait, no. Wait, in a DAG, edges go from a node to others. So for a node u, the moves[u] are the nodes it can move to. So when calculating the Grundy number for u, we need the Grundy numbers of all nodes in moves[u].

Wait, but topological order is such that all edges go from earlier to later nodes. So reverse topological order would have edges going from later to earlier. Hmm, maybe I need to process the nodes in topological order but in reverse.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a topological sort of the graph, which is a linear ordering where for every directed edge u → v, u comes before v. So in topological order, all predecessors of a node come before it. Wait, no: in topological order, u comes before v if there's an edge u → v. So when processing in topological order, when we get to node v, all nodes u that have edges to v have already been processed. But in our case, for node u, we need the Grundy numbers of its neighbors (v in moves[u]), which are the nodes u can move to. So for node u, the moves[u] are the children. So when processing u, we need the Grundy numbers of its children. Therefore, if the children are processed before u, then we can compute u's Grundy number. But in topological order, u comes before its children, which is the opposite. So perhaps we need to process the nodes in reverse topological order. That way, the children (which come after u in topological order) are processed before u in reverse order.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the correct approach is to process the nodes in reverse topological order. For each node u, collect the Grundy numbers of all its children (moves[u]), compute mex of those, and assign it to u.\n\nBut how do we get the reverse topological order?

We can use Kahn's algorithm, which works by repeatedly removing nodes with in-degree zero.\n\nAlternatively, since the graph is given as outgoing edges (moves[u] are the neighbors), we can compute the in-degrees for each node.

Wait, \"abcb\" has \"bcb\" as a subsequence which is length 3.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum length of such a subsequence.\n\nI remember that dynamic programming is often used for this kind of problem. Let me think about how to structure the DP.\n\nThe standard approach for longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) is to use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] represents the length of the LPS from index i to j.\n\nThe recurrence relation would be:\n\n- If the characters at i and j are the same, then dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2.\n- If they are different, then dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]).\n\nBase cases:\n- When i == j, dp[i][j] = 1 (single character is a palindrome).\n- When i > j, dp[i][j] = 0.\n\nSo we need to fill this table in a way that ensures the dependencies are already computed.

Let's see. A palindromic subsequence is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards, but the characters don't have to be consecutive in the original string.\n\nHmm, dynamic programming is probably the way to go here. I remember that for problems like longest common subsequence (LCS), DP is used. Wait, the longest palindromic subsequence can be thought of as the LCS of the string and its reverse. Because a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, so the LCS between s and reverse(s) should give the longest palindromic subsequence.\n\nLet me verify that. For example, take \"bbbab\". The reverse is \"babbb\". The LCS of these two is \"bbbb\", which has length 4. And the longest palindromic subsequence of \"bbbab\" is indeed 4 (like \"bbbb\"). Another example: \"cbbd\" reversed is \"dbbc\". The LCS is \"bb\", length 2, which matches the expected result. So this approach seems valid.\n\nSo the plan is: reverse the string, compute the LCS between s and its reverse. The length of that LCS is the answer.\n\nNow, how to compute LCS with DP. The standard DP approach for LCS uses a 2D table where dp[i][j] is the length of LCS of s1[0..i-1] and s2[0..j-1].\n\nThe recurrence is:\n- If i == 0 or j == 0: dp[i][j] = 0\n- If s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1\n- Else: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n\nSo for this problem, s2 is the reversed s.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the function:\n\n1. If the input string s is empty, return 0.\n2. Let rev_s = s[::-1]\n3. Create a DP table with dimensions (len(s)+1) x (len(s)+1)\n4. Fill the DP table according to LCS rules.\n5. The value at dp[len(s)][len(s)] is the answer.\n\nWait, but using a full 2D table might be memory-intensive for very long strings, but given that the problem doesn't specify constraints, and Python can handle it for reasonable lengths, this should be acceptable.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nExample 1: s = \"bbbab\"\nrev_s = \"babbb\"\nLCS is 4. So the function should return 4.\n\nExample 2: s = \"cbbd\"\nrev_s = \"dbbc\"\nLCS is \"bb\", so 2.\n\nAnother example: s = \"a\", rev_s = \"a\", LCS is 1.\n\nEdge case: s = \"\", returns 0.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\ndef longest_palindromic_subsequence(s: str) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    rev = s[::-1]\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, n+1):\n            if s[i-1] == rev[j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n    \n    return dp[n][n]\n\nWait, but this uses O(n^2) time and space. For the problem statement, this should be correct.\n\nAlternatively, there's a more space-efficient way by using two rows instead of the entire table, but the problem says to provide the minimal correct solution, so the straightforward 2D DP is acceptable.\n\nLet me check if there's another approach. For example, another DP approach specific to palindromic subsequences. The standard approach for longest palindromic subsequence is to use a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in s[i..j].\n\nThe recurrence would be:\n- If i == j: 1\n- If i > j: 0\n- If s[i] == s[j]: dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]\n- Else: dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n\nThis approach also uses O(n^2) time and space, but perhaps this is more direct. Let's see which is better.\n\nFor example, for s = \"bbbab\", the DP table would be filled for all i <= j.\n\nBut which approach is easier to implement? The LCS approach requires reversing the string and then computing LCS, which is a standard problem. The direct approach requires handling the i and j indices correctly.\n\nBut both approaches are valid. Let's see which one is more efficient. The LCS approach would have the same time complexity, but the direct approach might have a slightly smaller constant factor since it's tailored to the problem.\n\nWait, but the problem says to provide the minimal correct solution.

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, what's a palindromic subsequence? A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. So the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) is the longest such sequence that's a palindrome.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"bbbab\", the LPS is \"bbbb\" with length 4. Another example: \"cbbd\" has LPS \"bb\" with length 2.\n\nHow do I compute this efficiently? I remember that dynamic programming is often used for these kinds of problems. Let's think about the DP approach.\n\nThe idea is that for a string s, the LPS can be found by considering the first and last characters. If they are the same, then the LPS length is 2 plus the LPS of the substring in between. If they are different, then it's the maximum of the LPS of the substring excluding the first character or excluding the last character.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation would be:\n\nIf s[i] == s[j], then LPS(i, j) = 2 + LPS(i+1, j-1)\nElse, LPS(i, j) = max(LPS(i+1, j), LPS(i, j-1))\n\nBase cases: when i == j, LPS is 1 (single character). When i > j, LPS is 0.\n\nThis looks like a standard DP problem. The problem is similar to the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem, but here we're comparing the string with its reverse. Wait, another approach: the LPS of s is equal to the LCS of s and its reverse. Because a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, so the longest subsequence that is common between s and reverse(s) would be the LPS.\n\nBut maybe implementing the DP directly is more straightforward.\n\nLet's consider the DP table approach. Let's create a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the length of the LPS for the substring s[i..j].\n\nWe can fill this table diagonally. Starting with substrings of length 1 (all 1s), then length 2, etc.\n\nFor example, for a string of length n:\n\nInitialize a dp table of size n x n.\n\nFor all i from 0 to n-1:\n    dp[i][i] = 1\n\nThen for lengths l from 2 to n:\n    for i from 0 to n - l:\n        j = i + l - 1\n        if s[i] == s[j]:\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2\n        else:\n            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n\nWait, but when l=2, j = i+1. So for \"aa\", s[i] == s[j], then dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]. But i+1 is j, which is i+1, and j-1 is i, so i+1 > j-1, so dp[i+1][j-1] is 0. Hence, 2 + 0 = 2, which is correct.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nLet's test this with \"bbbab\" (length 5).\n\nIndices 0-4.\n\nInitialize dp with 1s on the diagonal.\n\nNow for l=2:\n\ni=0, j=1: s[0] = 'b', s[1] = 'b' → equal. dp[0][1] = 2 + dp[1][0] = 2 + 0 = 2.\n\ni=1, j=2: 'b' vs 'b' → 2.\n\ni=2, j=3: 'b' vs 'a' → max(dp[3][3], dp[2][2]) → max(1,1) = 1.\n\ni=3, j=4: 'a' vs 'b' → max(1,1) =1.\n\nThen l=3:\n\ni=0, j=2: s[0]='b', s[2]='b' → equal. dp[0][2] = 2 + dp[1][1] = 2 +1=3.\n\ni=1, j=3: 'b' vs 'a' → max(dp[2][3]=1, dp[1][2]=2) → 2.\n\ni=2, j=4: 'b' vs 'b' → 2 + dp[3][3] = 2+1=3.\n\nl=4:\n\ni=0, j=3: s[0]='b', s[3]='a' → max(dp[1][3]=2, dp[0][2]=3) → 3.\n\ni=1, j=4: s[1]='b', s[4]='b' → 2 + dp[2][3] = 2 +1=3.\n\nl=5:\n\ni=0, j=4: s[0]='b', s[4]='b' → equal. So 2 + dp[1][3] (which is 2) → 4. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the final dp[0][4] is 4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: \"cbbd\".\n\nn=4.\n\ndp table:\n\nAfter initialization (diagonal 1s):\n\nl=2:\n\ni=0, j=1: 'c' vs 'b' → max(1,1) →1.\n\ni=1, j=2: 'b' vs 'b' → 2.\n\ni=2, j=3: 'b' vs 'd' →1.\n\nl=3:\n\ni=0, j=2: 'c' vs 'b' → max(dp[1][2]=2, dp[0][1]=1) →2.\n\ni=1, j=3: 'b' vs 'd' → max(dp[2][3]=1, dp[1][2]=2) →2.\n\nl=4:\n\ni=0, j=3: 'c' vs 'd' → max(dp[1][3]=2, dp[0][2]=2) →2.\n\nSo the answer is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo the DP approach seems to work.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nWe can create a 2D list for dp.

For example, in \"babad\", the longest palindromic subsequence is \"bab\" or \"aba\", which has length 3.\n\nHmm, dynamic programming seems like a good approach here. I remember that for problems involving subsequences, DP is often useful because we can break it down into smaller subproblems.\n\nLet's consider the DP table where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring s[i..j].\n\nThe base case would be when i == j, meaning a single character. Since a single character is a palindrome of length 1, dp[i][i] = 1.\n\nFor the case where i < j:\n- If the characters at positions i and j are the same, then we can add 2 to the result of the subsequence from i+1 to j-1. So dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2.\n- If they are different, then the longest subsequence would be the maximum of either excluding the character at i (so dp[i+1][j]) or excluding the character at j (dp[i][j-1]).\n\nWait, but how do we fill the DP table? Since the subproblems depend on smaller substrings, we need to iterate in a way that when computing dp[i][j], the required smaller subproblems are already solved.\n\nSo, perhaps we can iterate the length of the substring from 1 to n (the length of s), and for each possible starting index i, compute j = i + length - 1.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a 2D DP array of size n x n with zeros.\n2. For all single characters, set dp[i][i] = 1.\n3. For lengths from 2 to n:\n   a. For each starting index i from 0 to n - length:\n      i. j = i + length - 1\n      ii. If s[i] == s[j]:\n          dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2\n      iii.

For example, if s is \"aa\", then i=0, j=1. s[0] == s[1], so dp[0][1] = dp[1][0] + 2. Wait, dp[i+1][j-1] when i+1 > j-1 would be 0? Because if i=0, j=1, then i+1 = 1, j-1 =0, which is invalid. So for cases where i > j, the value is 0.\n\nWait, in the case where the substring length is 2, like \"aa\", then s[0] and s[1] are equal. So dp[i][j] = 2 (since dp[1][0] is 0, so 0 + 2 = 2). That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: \"ab\". Since s[0] != s[1], dp[0][1] = max(dp[1][1], dp[0][0]) = 1.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the DP approach seems correct.\n\nLet me test with a sample input.

So dp[0][2] = dp[1][1] +2 =1+2=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for i=1, j=3 (\"aba\"):\n\ns[1] = 'a', s[3] = 'a' → equal. dp[1][3] = dp[2][2] +2 =1+2=3.\n\nSo that's another possible subsequence.\n\nThen for length 4 and 5.\n\nContinuing, but perhaps the code will handle it.\n\nSo the code should correctly compute dp[0][4] as 3.\n\nAnother test case: \"cbbd\".\n\nThe longest palindromic subsequence is \"bb\", length 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=4.\n\ndp[0][0] =1, dp[1][1]=1, etc.\n\nFor length 2:\n\ni=0, j=1: 'c' and 'b' → max(1,1) →1.\n\ni=1, j=2: 'b' and 'b' → 2.\n\ni=2, j=3: 'b' and 'd' →1.\n\nLength 3:\n\ni=0, j=2: 'c' vs 'b' → no. dp[0][2] = max(dp[1][2], dp[0][1]) = max(2,1) →2.\n\ni=1, j=3: 'b' vs 'd' → max(dp[2][3]=1, dp[1][2]=2) →2.\n\nLength 4:\n\ni=0, j=3: 'c' vs 'd' → max(dp[1][3]=2, dp[0][2]=2) →2.\n\nSo the answer is 2.

Let me recall how Newton's method works. The basic idea is to iteratively update the current point x using the inverse of the Hessian multiplied by the gradient. But sometimes the step might be too big, so backtracking line search is used to find a suitable step size that satisfies the Armijo condition.\n\nFirst, the function signature is newton_backtracking_line_search(f, grad, hess, x0) where f is the objective function, grad is the gradient, hess is the Hessian, and x0 is the initial point as a list of floats.\n\nThe main steps for Newton's method with backtracking:\n\n1. Compute the Newton direction: d = -H^{-1} * g, where H is the Hessian and g is the gradient at current x.\n\nBut wait, for 2D, the Hessian is a 2x2 matrix. So I need to solve H * d = -g for d. Since it's convex, the Hessian should be positive definite, so the inverse exists (or at least the system is solvable).\n\n2. Then, perform backtracking line search to find the step size t. Start with t = 1, and reduce it by a factor beta (like 0.5) until the Armijo condition is met.\n\nArmijo condition: f(x + t*d) <= f(x) + c * t * grad(f, x)^T * d\n\nWhere c is a constant, typically 0.1 or 0.01.\n\nWait, but since d is the Newton direction, which is a descent direction (because H is positive definite), the dot product of grad and d should be negative. So the Armijo condition ensures sufficient decrease.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nWhile not converged:\n\n   Compute gradient g and Hessian H at current x.\n\n   Solve H * d = -g for d (Newton direction)\n\n   If the norm of d is very small, stop (converged)\n\n   Set t = 1\n\n   While f(x + t*d) > f(x) + c * t * (g^T d):\n\n        t = beta * t\n\n   x = x + t*d\n\nBut need to choose parameters c and beta.

Wait, the user says \"include ONE final Python code block\", but the problem is for 2D, so maybe using numpy is acceptable, but the question says \"minimal\". However, since it's 2D, perhaps we can do matrix inversion manually.\n\nWait, the Hessian is 2x2. So for a 2x2 matrix [[a, b], [b, c]], the inverse is (1/(ac - b²)) * [[c, -b], [-b, a]].\n\nSo maybe to avoid numpy, we can compute the inverse directly.\n\nBut the problem says \"careful engineer\", so maybe better to handle the inversion carefully.\n\nSo steps in code:\n\nGiven x as a list (or array), compute grad and hess at x.\n\nCompute the Newton direction d.\n\nBut for 2D, hess is a 2x2 matrix. Let's say hess returns a list of lists, like [[h11, h12], [h21, h22]].

Let me think through the steps.\n\nFirst, Newton's method typically uses the formula x_{k+1} = x_k - [Hessian]^{-1} * gradient. But sometimes the step might be too large, so we use a line search to find a better step size. The backtracking line search starts with a step size (like alpha=1) and reduces it until the Armijo condition is satisfied.\n\nArmijo condition: f(x_k + alpha * d) <= f(x_k) + c * alpha * grad(f)(x_k)^T d, where d is the search direction. Here, d is the Newton direction, which is -Hessian^{-1} * gradient. For convex functions, the Hessian should be positive definite, so the direction should be a descent direction.\n\nWait, but in Newton's method, the search direction d = -Hessian^{-1} grad. So grad^T d should be negative (since Hessian is positive definite, so d is a descent direction). Therefore, the Armijo condition checks if the function decreases sufficiently.\n\nThe parameters for backtracking usually include c (like 0.5) and a reduction factor (like 0.5). Start with alpha=1, check if the condition holds. If not, multiply alpha by the factor (e.g., 0.5) and check again until it does.\n\nSo the steps for the line search part:\n\n1. Compute the Newton direction d = -inv(H) * grad.\n2. Set alpha = 1.\n3. While f(x + alpha*d) > f(x) + c * alpha * grad^T d:\n   a. alpha = alpha * beta (beta is like 0.5)\n4. Return x + alpha*d as the next iterate.\n\nBut wait, for convex functions, the Hessian is positive definite, so the Newton direction is a descent direction, which ensures that for small enough alpha, the Armijo condition will be satisfied.\n\nNow, the function to implement is newton_backtracking_line_search(f, grad, hess, x0) which returns the next point.\n\nWait, the problem says \"improve Newton with Armijo backtracking for small 2D convex f\". So the function should take f (the function), grad (gradient function), hess (Hessian function), and x0 (initial point as list of floats). The output is the next point after one iteration with backtracking.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Implement newton_backtracking_line_search(f,grad,hess,x0:list[float])->list[float]\". So the function is supposed to perform one step of Newton with backtracking, returning the new x.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is to implement the line search part as part of Newton's method. So given x0, compute the Newton step with backtracking to get x1.\n\nSo steps in the function:\n\n1. Compute gradient at x0: g = grad(x0)\n2. Compute Hessian at x0: H = hess(x0)\n3. Solve H * d = -g for d (since Newton direction is d = -H^{-1} g)\n   But in 2D, H is a 2x2 matrix. So we can compute the inverse or solve the linear system.\n4. Compute the search direction d.\n5. Then perform backtracking line search to find alpha.\n6. Return x0 + alpha*d.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"improve Newton with Armijo backtracking\". So the standard Newton step is x0 + d (with alpha=1), but if that doesn't satisfy Armijo, we backtrack.\n\nNow, the Armijo condition: f(x0 + alpha*d) <= f(x0) + c * alpha * (grad(x0) · d)\n\nBecause grad(x0) · d is the directional derivative in direction d.\n\nSince d is the Newton direction, which for convex functions is a descent direction, so grad · d < 0.\n\nParameters for backtracking: need to choose c (usually 1e-4) and beta (like 0.5). The problem doesn't specify, so I should use standard values.\n\nSo in code:\n\n- c = 0.5 (maybe 0.1 or 0.5; sometimes 0.5 is used for Armijo)\nWait, common choice is c=1e-4, but maybe the problem expects a typical value. Let's check.\n\nWait, the Armijo rule uses a small c, like 0.0001, but sometimes for simplicity, people use 0.5. Hmm. But in practice, c is small. However, the problem says \"small 2D convex f\", maybe the example is simple. Let's use c=0.5 as a default, but perhaps the standard is 1e-4. Wait, no, the standard Armijo condition uses c in (0, 0.5), but perhaps the problem expects c=0.5.

The Armijo condition ensures sufficient decrease.\n\nSo the steps would be: at each iteration, compute the Newton direction d = -H^{-1} * grad. Then, do a backtracking line search along d to find a step size alpha that satisfies the Armijo condition.\n\nArmijo condition is f(x + alpha*d) <= f(x) + c*alpha*grad^T d, where c is usually 1e-4.\n\nBacktracking starts with alpha = 1, then reduces it by a factor (like beta=0.5) until the condition is met.\n\nWait, but since the problem is convex and the Hessian is positive definite, the Newton direction should be a descent direction, so grad^T d should be negative. Because d = -H^{-1} grad, so grad^T d = - grad^T H^{-1} grad. Since H is positive definite, H^{-1} is positive definite, so this is negative.

Compute grad and hess at current x.\n   b. Solve H d = -grad to get direction d.\n   c.

But the function should terminate when the gradient is small enough, or when the step size is very small.\n\nBut the problem says \"implement newton_backtracking_line_search\" to improve Newton with Armijo backtracking.

So the standard Newton method may take a full step (alpha=1), but sometimes even for convex functions, the full step might not decrease the function enough, so backtracking is used to find a suitable alpha.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Compute the Newton direction.\n- Use backtracking to choose alpha.\n- Update x.\n\nNow, the parameters for backtracking: c (Armijo parameter) and beta (reduction factor). Common choices are c=1e-4, beta=0.5.\n\nThe backtracking loop:\n\nalpha = 1.0\n\nwhile f(x + alpha*d) > f(x) + c*alpha*grad.T @ d:\n    alpha *= beta\n    if alpha < some epsilon, break?

But for convex functions, the Hessian should be positive definite, so the direction is a descent direction. However, sometimes the step size might be too large, so backtracking line search adjusts the step to satisfy Armijo's condition.\n\nArmijo's condition is that the function value at the new point is less than the current value plus a fraction (like 0.5) of the step size times the directional derivative. The directional derivative here would be the gradient dotted with the search direction.\n\nWait, the search direction in Newton's method is -H^{-1} grad.

Since H is positive definite, this is negative. So the Armijo condition is f(x + alpha d) <= f(x) + c * alpha * (grad^T d). Wait, but grad^T d is negative, so the right-hand side is f(x) minus some positive term. So the function should decrease by at least that amount.\n\nWait, Armijo condition is usually written as f(x + alpha d) <= f(x) + c1 * alpha * grad_f(x)^T d. Since d is a descent direction, grad_f(x)^T d < 0, so this means the function should decrease by at least c1 * alpha * |grad_f(x)^T d|.\n\nSo in code, for each step:\n\n- Compute d = -inv(H) @ grad\n- Then, set alpha = 1\n- While f(x + alpha*d) > f(x) + c * alpha * (grad @ d), multiply alpha by beta (like 0.5)\n- Then x = x + alpha*d\n\nNow, parameters: c is usually 0.5, beta is 0.5 or 0.8.\n\nBut the problem says \"improve Newton with Armijo backtracking for small 2D convex f\".

I need to find the expected number of rolls to get a specific sequence of numbers when rolling a die with 'sides' sides. The problem mentions using an Aho automaton with dynamic programming. Hmm, I remember that for problems like expected time to see a sequence, the standard approach is using states based on the current suffix of the sequence that matches the target.\n\nFirst, I should recall the concept of the Aho-Corasick automaton. It's used for string matching, building a trie of the patterns and adding failure links. But here, since we're dealing with a single sequence, maybe it's simpler. Oh right, for the expected number of trials to get a specific sequence, the method involves setting up states where each state represents the length of the current matching prefix of the target sequence.\n\nWait, the problem is similar to the classic \"expected number of coin flips to get a certain sequence,\" but with a die that has 'sides' faces. For example, for a fair coin (sides=2), the expected number to get \"HH\" is 6. The approach there uses states based on how much of the target sequence we've matched so far.\n\nSo, let's model this with states. Suppose the target sequence is seq of length n. The states are 0, 1, ..., n, where state i means the last i characters match the first i characters of seq. We start at state 0, and we want to reach state n.\n\nFor each state i (from 0 to n-1), when we roll the die, we get a new character (number) x. We need to determine the next state j, which is the length of the longest prefix of seq that matches the suffix of the current sequence (which is the previous i characters plus x).\n\nThis is similar to the KMP failure function. For each position i in the sequence, we can precompute the longest proper suffix which is also a prefix. This helps in determining, when a mismatch occurs, how much of the prefix we can keep.\n\nWait, but in this case, since we're building the next state based on adding a new character, for each state i and possible roll x, we can compute the next state. For example, if we're in state i and we roll x, then the next state is the largest j such that the first j characters of seq match the last j characters of (seq[0..i-1] + x).\n\nSo the key is to precompute for each state i and each possible x, what the next state j is. Then, using dynamic programming, we can set up equations for E[i], the expected number of rolls needed to reach state n from state i.\n\nThe base case is E[n] = 0, since we're already done. For other states, E[i] = 1 + sum over all possible x (probability of x * E[next_state(i, x)]).\n\nBut since each roll is independent and each face has probability 1/sides, for each state i, we can compute the expected value based on transitions.\n\nNow, the challenge is efficiently computing the next_state(i, x) for each i and x. This is where the Aho-Corasick automaton comes in, but for a single pattern, it's equivalent to the KMP failure function.\n\nLet me think. For the sequence seq, we can build a transition table. For each state i (current match length), and for each possible next character x, the next state is:\n\n- If x == seq[i], then next state is i+1.\n- Else, we look for the longest proper suffix of seq[0..i-1] + x that matches a prefix of seq. Wait, no. Actually, when we have a current match of length i, and we add x, if x is not seq[i], then we need to find the largest k < i such that the first k characters of seq match the last k characters of (seq[0..i-1] + x). But since the current sequence before adding x was seq[0..i-1], adding x gives a new sequence of length i+1, but we only care about the suffix that matches the prefix of the target.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to use the failure function from KMP. The failure function (or prefix function) for position i is the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix for the substring seq[0..i].\n\nWait, but here, when we are in state i (meaning the last i characters match the first i of the target), and we roll a new character x. If x equals seq[i], then we move to state i+1.

For that, people often use states representing the current suffix of the sequence matched so far, and set up equations based on transitions between states.\n\nOh right! The standard approach for these problems is to model it as a Markov chain where each state represents the length of the current matching prefix of the target sequence. Then, using dynamic programming, we can compute the expected number of steps to reach the absorbing state (the full sequence).\n\nBut how do we handle overlaps in the sequence? For example, if the target is \"ABAB\", then after failing at the fourth character (if we get something other than B), maybe the suffix \"AB\" could still match the start of the sequence. So the failure links in Aho-Corasick help find the longest proper suffix which is also a prefix. That's exactly what we need here for the state transitions when a mismatch occurs.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Build a trie (or a state machine) where each state corresponds to the length of the current matching prefix (from 0 up to len(seq)).\n2. For each state i (current matched length), and for each possible die roll (1 to sides), determine the next state j. If the roll matches seq[i], then j = i+1. If not, we need to find the largest k < i such that the first k characters of seq match the suffix of the current string (after adding the new roll). This k is the next state.\n3. Using dynamic programming, let E[i] be the expected number of additional rolls needed to reach the end from state i. Our goal is E[0].\n4. The recurrence is E[i] = 1 + sum_{possible outcomes} (probability of outcome * E[next_state]).\n5. For the absorbing state (i = len(seq)), E[i] = 0.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the next state when there's a mismatch? For example, suppose the current state is i, and we roll a number that doesn't match seq[i]. Then we need to backtrack to the longest possible prefix that is a suffix of the current sequence plus the new roll.\n\nThis is where the failure function (like in KMP) comes in. For each position i in the sequence, we precompute the longest proper suffix which is also a prefix. For example, for the sequence [1,2,1,2], when at state 4 (fully matched), but if we're at state 3 (matched first three elements: 1,2,1) and the next roll is not 2, then we need to see what's the longest prefix that matches the new suffix.\n\nWait, maybe the standard KMP prefix function (pi array) can be used here. The pi array for position i gives the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix for the substring seq[0..i].\n\nSo, for each state i (0-based, current matched length), when we process a new character c:\n\n- If c == seq[i], then next state is i+1.\n- Else, we look for the largest k < i such that seq[0..k-1] is a suffix of seq[0..i-1] + [c]. But how to compute this efficiently?\n\nWait, in KMP, the failure function for position i is the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix for seq[0..i]. So when there's a mismatch at position i (i.e., after matching i characters, the next character doesn't match seq[i]), we set i = pi[i-1], and check again.\n\nBut in our case, when we are in state i (have matched i characters), and the next roll is c. If c equals seq[i], we go to i+1. If not, we need to find the largest k such that the first k characters of seq match the last k characters of (the previous i characters + c). So the new state is k.\n\nThis is exactly what the KMP failure function helps with.

I need to calculate the expected number of rolls to get a specific sequence of consecutive outcomes when rolling a die with 'sides' faces. The function is called expected_rolls_to_get_sequence(seq, sides). The user mentioned using an Aho-Corasick automaton with dynamic programming. Hmm, I remember that the Aho-Corasick algorithm is used for string matching, building a trie with failure links. But how does that relate to expected values here?\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to the problem of finding the expected number of trials to get a specific pattern in a sequence of independent trials. For example, the classic problem of flipping a coin until you get \"HH\" or \"HT\". In those cases, you set up states based on the current suffix of the observed sequence that matches a prefix of the target.\n\nSo for a given target sequence, you can model the problem as a Markov chain where each state represents the length of the current matching prefix. When you roll a new number, you transition to the next state based on how much the new sequence matches the target.\n\nFor instance, if the target is [1,2,3], then the states are 0 (no match), 1 (matched first element), 2 (matched first two), and 3 (done). The expected number of steps from state 0 is what we need.\n\nThe approach would involve setting up equations for the expected number of steps from each state. Let E[k] be the expected number of additional rolls needed to reach the end when currently in state k (having matched the first k elements of the sequence).\n\nThe base case is E[n] = 0, where n is the length of the sequence.\n\nFor each state k < n, when we roll the next number, there's a 1/sides chance for each possible outcome. Depending on the outcome, we might transition to a new state. If the next number matches the (k+1)th element of the sequence, we go to state k+1. Otherwise, we might fall back to a previous state based on the longest proper suffix which is also a prefix (like the failure function in KMP).\n\nWait, so this is similar to the KMP algorithm's failure function. For each state k, we need to know, for each possible next character c, what's the next state. The next state would be the length of the longest prefix of the target that matches the suffix of the current sequence plus c.\n\nFor example, if the target is [a, b, c], and current state is 2 (so we've matched [a,b]), and the next roll is d. If d is not c, then we look for the longest prefix that matches the suffix of [a,b,d]. The suffix here would be [b,d], but since d isn't c, maybe the longest prefix is 0 or 1? Wait, depends on the target.\n\nSo for each state k and each possible next symbol, we compute the next state m, which is the length of the longest prefix of the target that is a suffix of (target[0:k] + [c]). This m can be precomputed using the KMP failure function.\n\nTherefore, for each state k, the expected value E[k] satisfies:\n\nE[k] = 1 + (1/sides) * sum_{c=1 to sides} E[ next_state(k, c) ]\n\nBut since some transitions might lead to the same next state, we can group them.\n\nWait, but for the specific next symbol that matches the target[k], we transition to k+1. For other symbols, we transition to some m < k+1.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nE[k] = 1 + (1/sides) * [ E[k+1] + sum_{c != target[k]} E[ m(k, c) ] ]\n\nBut how do we compute m(k, c) for each c?\n\nThis is where the KMP failure function comes into play. For each position k in the target sequence, and for each possible character c, we can determine the next state.\n\nWait, but the standard KMP failure function gives the longest prefix which is also a suffix for the substring up to k. However, when we have a mismatch at position k (i.e., after matching k characters, the next character is c which doesn't match target[k]), the next state is determined by the failure function.\n\nBut in our case, for each possible c (including the correct one), we need to find the next state. For the correct c (i.e., c == target[k]), next state is k+1. For incorrect c, we need to find the largest m < k+1 such that the first m characters of the target match the last m character", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.17333333333333334, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 2295, "metadata": {"tests": ["E=expected_rolls_to_get_sequence([1,2,3],6); assert E>0"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

Hmm, I remember that the Aho-Corasick algorithm is used for string matching, building a trie of patterns and then using failure links. But how does that apply here for expected value calculations?\n\nWait, there's a method called the \"Markov chain\" approach where each state represents the current progress towards matching the target sequence. For example, if the sequence is [1,2,3], then states could be 0 (no match), 1 (matched first element), 2 (matched first two), 3 (matched all, which is the absorbing state). The expected number of steps to reach state 3 from state 0 is what we need.\n\nBut how do the transitions work? Let's think. Suppose we're in state i, meaning we've matched the first i characters of the sequence. When we roll the next number, say x, we check if x equals the (i+1)th character of the sequence. If yes, we go to state i+1. If not, we need to find the longest possible suffix of the current string (which is the matched part plus x) that matches a prefix of the target sequence. That's where the failure function from Aho-Corasick comes in. So for each state i and possible roll x, we determine the next state j, which could be i+1 if x matches, or some j < i based on overlaps.\n\nSo the DP state would be E[i], the expected number of additional rolls needed to reach the end from state i. Our goal is E[0]. The base case is E[n] = 0, where n is the length of the sequence.\n\nFor each state i < n, when we roll the die, there's a 1/sides chance for each outcome. For each possible outcome x:\n\n- If x equals seq[i], then we move to state i+1.\n- Otherwise, we need to find the largest k < i such that the first k elements of seq match the last k elements of the current string (which is seq[0..i-1] followed by x). This k is determined by the failure function of the Aho-Corasick automaton.\n\nWait, but how do we compute k for each i and x? Maybe we can precompute a transition table. Let's consider the sequence as a string, and build a KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) failure function, which is similar. The KMP prefix function gives for each position i the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix for the substring up to i.\n\nBut in this problem, when we are at state i (having matched the first i characters), and we read a new character x, if x is not seq[i], we need to find the largest k such that the prefix of length k matches the suffix of the current string (which is the first i characters plus x). Wait, the current string would be seq[0..i-1] + [x]. So we need the longest k where seq[0..k-1] == (seq[0..i-1] + x)[i - k + 1 ... i].\n\nThis is similar to the KMP failure function, but the failure function for KMP is for when there's a mismatch at position i. Wait, perhaps the transition for state i on input x is given by the KMP automaton's transition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each state i (current match length), and each possible die face x, the next state j is the length of the longest prefix of seq that is a suffix of (current prefix + x). So for example, if seq is [1,2,1], and current state is 2 (we've matched [1,2]), and we roll a 1, then the new string is [1,2,1], which matches the full sequence, so j=3. But if we roll a 2 instead, the new string is [1,2,2]. The longest prefix that is a suffix here would be length 0, because the suffix '22' doesn't match the start of [1,2,1]. Wait, no: the current prefix is [1,2], adding 2 gives [1,2,2]. The possible prefixes to check are:\n\nCheck if the entire [1,2,2] ends with seq[0..k-1] for k=3: seq[0..2] is [1,2,1], which doesn't match [1,2,2], so k=3 no.\n\nk=2: seq[0..1] is [1,2]. The last two elements of [1,2,2] are [2,2], which doesn't match [1,2], so no.\n\nk=1: seq[0] is 1. The last element is 2, which doesn't match 1. So k=0.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a longer match. Wait, perhaps the suffix is [2,2], but seq starts with 1, so no.

So, for each row, I choose a column, but the column for the next row can't be the same as the current one. Wait, no—adjacent rows cannot use the same column.

Wait, no, maybe it's that consecutive rows can't have the same column.

Row 1 is column 1 (value 4), then row 2 can't be column 1, so must be 0. So 1+4+5=10.\n\nAnother path: 0->0 invalid (row0 and row1 same column). So row0=0, row1 must be 1.

For large n, this could be slow. But maybe for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable. Wait, but the problem says \"minimal correct solution\", so maybe we can optimize.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smarter way. For each row, if we precompute the minimum value and the second minimum, then for each column j in the next row, if the previous row's minimum was at column j, then we take the second minimum; otherwise, take the minimum.\n\nAh, that's a common technique in DP problems where you need the min of all except the current index.\n\nSo, for each row i-1, we can store:\n\n- min_val: the minimum dp value in the row\n- min_idx: the index where this minimum occurs\n- second_min: the second minimum value in the row\n\nThen, for row i, when computing dp[i][j], if the previous row's min was at index j, then we have to use second_min; otherwise, use min_val.\n\nThis would allow us to compute each dp[i][j] in O(1) time per element, leading to O(m*n) time overall.\n\nYes, that's a good approach. Let's see.\n\nLet's work through an example.\n\nSuppose previous row's dp is [1, 2, 3]. Then min_val is 1 (index 0), second_min is 2.\n\nFor the next row, when j=0, we can't take the previous min (since it's at index 0), so we take second_min (2). For j=1 and j=2, we can take min_val (1).\n\nAnother example: previous dp is [3, 1, 1]. Then min_val is 1, but there are two indices (1 and 2) with value 1. So second_min is also 1. So for any j, if previous min is at j, but since there are multiple mins, even if j is one of them, the second_min is same as min, so we can take min_val. Wait, no. Wait, in this case, for j=1, the previous row's min_val is 1 (at index 1 and 2). So when we are at j=1 in the current row, the previous row's min_val could be taken from index 2 (which is allowed, since 2 !=1). So the min for previous row excluding j=1 is min(3, 1) (but wait, previous row is [3,1,1]. So excluding j=1, the values are 3 and 1 (index 0 and 2). The min is 1. So in this case, even though min_val is 1, and the current j is 1, there's another index (2) with the same value, so the min excluding j is still 1.\n\nAh, so the second_min approach works only if the minimum is unique.

Let's think.\n\nFor each row, and for each possible column, we can track the minimum sum to reach that cell, considering the constraints.\n\nLet's say dp[i][j] is the minimum sum to reach row i, column j.\n\nFor the first row (i=0), dp[0][j] = mat[0][j], since there's no previous row.\n\nFor subsequent rows (i >= 1), dp[i][j] = mat[i][j] + min of all dp[i-1][k] where k != j.\n\nWait, because the previous row (i-1) can't have the same column j. So for each j in row i, we look at all columns k in row i-1 where k is not equal to j, take the minimum of those dp values, and add mat[i][j].\n\nSo the recurrence is dp[i][j] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][k] for k != j)\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum value in the last row of dp.\n\nLet's test this with a small example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nmat = [\n  [1,2,3],\n  [4,5,6],\n  [7,8,9]\n]\n\nFirst row: dp[0] = [1,2,3]\n\nSecond row:\n\nFor j=0: min of dp[0][1], dp[0][2] → min(2,3)=2 → 4+2=6\n\nj=1: min(1,3) =1 →5+1=6\n\nj=2: min(1,2)=1 →6+1=7\n\nSo dp[1] = [6,6,7]\n\nThird row:\n\nFor j=0: min of dp[1][1], dp[1][2] → min(6,7)=6 →7+6=13\n\nj=1: min(6,7)=6 →8+6=14\n\nj=2: min(6,6)=6 →9+6=15\n\nSo dp[2] = [13,14,15], min is 13.\n\nBut wait, let's check the path: row0 col0 (1), row1 col1 (5), row2 col0 (7). Wait no, row2 can't be same as row1. Wait row1 is col1 (5), row2 can't be col1, so for row2 col0, it's allowed. So 1+5+7=13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: if the matrix is 2x2.\n\nmat = [[1,2],[3,4]]\n\nFirst row: [1,2]\n\nSecond row:\n\nj=0: min of dp[0][1] = 2 →3+2=5\n\nj=1: min of dp[0][0] =1 →4+1=5\n\nSo min sum is 5.\n\nWhich corresponds to 1+4 or 2+3, both sum 5. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nFor each row after the first, for each column j, we need to find the minimum of the previous row's dp except for j.\n\nIf we do this naively, for each j, iterate through all k != j in previous row, take min. For an n x m matrix, that's O(n*m^2) time.\n\nBut maybe we can optimize this.\n\nFor the previous row, if we precompute the minimum value and the second minimum, then for each j, if the previous row's minimum is at a column not equal to j, then we can take the minimum. Otherwise, take the second minimum.\n\nWait, but the columns are ordered. Let's think.\n\nSuppose in the previous row (i-1), the minimum value is min_val, and it occurs at index min_idx. The second minimum is second_min, occurring at any other index.\n\nThen, for the current row's column j:\n\nif j != min_idx, then the minimum possible value from previous row is min_val.\n\nelse, we have to take second_min.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple indices with the same min_val? For example, previous row has [2, 1, 1], min_val is 1, min_idx could be 1 and 2.\n\nIn that case, if current j is 1, then min_val from previous row (excluding j=1) would be 1 (from index 2). So even if min_val occurs at multiple places, as long as there's another index with min_val, then for j equal to one of the min_idx, the min is still min_val.\n\nWait, no. Suppose previous row is [1,1,2]. min_val is 1, occurs at 0 and 1.\n\nFor current j=0: we need to take min of previous row's k !=0 → which is min(1,2) →1.\n\nSimilarly for j=1: min of previous row's k !=1 → min(1,2) →1.\n\nSo in th", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.17333333333333334, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 2177, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert min_falling_path_sum_no_adjacent_col([[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[3,3,1]])==3"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum falling path sum in a matrix, but with a twist: adjacent rows can't use the same column. Wait, the problem says \"adjacent rows cannot use same column\". So when moving from one row to the next, the column has to be different. But wait, the problem statement says \"choose one element per row; adjacent rows cannot use same column.\" Oh, right, so for each consecutive pair of rows, the columns selected must not be the same.\n\nSo the task is to pick one element from each row such that no two consecutive rows have the same column, and the sum of all selected elements is minimized.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. This sounds like a dynamic programming problem. Because for each row, the choice of column affects the next row's possible choices.\n\nLet me consider the example. Suppose the matrix is:\n\nrow 0: [a, b, c]\nrow 1: [d, e, f]\nrow 2: [g, h, i]\n\nFor row 0, the possible choices are a, b, c. For row 1, if I chose column 0 (a) in row 0, then in row 1 I can't choose column 0 again. So for each position in row 1, the minimum sum up to that point would be the minimum of the sums from the previous row's columns except the same column.\n\nWait, so for each cell (i, j), the value would be the minimum of the previous row's cells where the column is not j, plus mat[i][j].\n\nSo the DP state could be dp[i][j] = minimum sum up to row i, column j.\n\nThe recurrence would be dp[i][j] = mat[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][k] for all k != j)\n\nThe base case is the first row: dp[0][j] = mat[0][j]\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of dp[last row][j] for all j.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me test this logic with a small example.\n\nTake a 2x2 matrix:\n\nmat = [\n  [1, 2],\n  [3, 4]\n]\n\nFor row 0, dp[0][0] = 1, dp[0][1] = 2.\n\nFor row 1, column 0: must take min of previous row's columns except 0. So only column 1, which is 2. So dp[1][0] = 3 + 2 =5.\n\nSimilarly, dp[1][1] = 4 + 1 =5.\n\nThe minimum sum is 5.\n\nWhich is correct: 1+4 or 2+3, both sum to 5.\n\nAnother example. Let's take 3x3:\n\nmat = [\n  [1,2,3],\n  [4,5,6],\n  [7,8,9]\n]\n\nRow 0: [1,2,3]\n\nRow 1: for each column:\n\ncol 0: min of row0 col1 and col2 → min(2,3) → 2. So 4 +2=6\n\ncol1: min of row0 col0 and col2 → min(1,3) →1 →5+1=6\n\ncol2: min of row0 col0 and col1 →1 →6+1=7\n\nSo row1: [6,6,7]\n\nRow2:\n\ncol0: min of row1 col1 and col2 → min(6,7) →6 →7+6=13\n\ncol1: min of row1 col0 and col2 → min(6,7) →6 →8+6=14\n\ncol2: min of row1 col0 and col1 →6 →9+6=15\n\nMinimum sum is 13. Which would be 1 (row0 col0) →5 (row1 col1) →7 (row2 col0). Wait, but adjacent rows can't have same column. So row0 col0, row1 col1 (different), row2 col0 (different from row1 col1). So that's allowed. Sum 1+5+7=13.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the DP approach seems valid.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nFor each row after the first, for each column j, we need the minimum of the previous row's dp values except for j.\n\nIf the matrix is m rows x n columns, then for each row, each column, we need to find the min of the previous row's elements except the same column.\n\nBut if we do this naively, for each j, loop through all k != j in previous row, it's O(n^2) per row, leading to O(mn^2) time. For large n, this could be slow, but perhaps acceptable for small n. However, the problem doesn't specify constraints, so we should look for an optimized way.\n\nWait, for each row, we can precompute the minimum value of the previous row, but need to handle cases where the current column is the one where the min is.\n\nFor example, suppose the previous row's minimum is at index k. Then, for the current row's column j, if j != k, then the min of previous row excluding j is the same as the global min. But if j == k, then we need the second smallest value in the previous row.\n\nAh, right. So for each row, we can compute the minimum and the second minimum. Then, for each j in current row:\n\nif previous row's min was at a column different from j, then use the min. Otherwise, use the second min.\n\nWait, more precisely: For the previous row's dp array, let min1 be ", "score": 1.0, "policy_score": 1.0, "combined_score": 1.0, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 2315, "metadata": {"tests": ["assert min_falling_path_sum_no_adjacent_col([[1,2,3],[1,2,3],[3,3,1]])==3"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

The denominator is π multiplied by D multiplied by (D - sqrt(D² - d²)). So the structure is 2P / [π * D * (D - sqrt(D² - d²))].\n\nI need to translate this into Python code. Let me check the order of operations. The denominator has to be calculated properly, especially the square root part. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, compute D squared minus d squared: D**2 - d**2. Then take the square root of that. Subtract that result from D. Multiply by D and π. Then the numerator is 2*P. Divide numerator by denominator.\n\nWait, the denominator is π * D * (D - sqrt(...)). So yes.\n\nI need to make sure that the denominator doesn't become zero, but the problem statement doesn't mention handling errors, so probably just assume valid inputs.\n\nNow, in Python, math module has sqrt and pi.

So maybe the code should be as concise as possible. Let me check if all parentheses are correctly placed.\n\nYes, the denominator is π*D*(D - sqrt(D² - d²)), which in code is math.pi * D * (D - math.sqrt(D**2 - d**2)).\n\nWait, the formula has (D - sqrt(D^2 - d^2)), so in code, that's D - math.sqrt(D**2 - d**2).\n\nTesting with sample values. Suppose D=10, d=5, P=3000. Let's compute:\n\nD² = 100, d²=25, D² -d²=75, sqrt(75)=8.660..., so D - sqrt(...) = 10 -8.660=1.3397.\n\nDenominator: π *10 *1.3397 ≈ 3.1416 *10*1.3397 ≈42.1.\n\nNumerator: 2*3000=6000.\n\nHB=6000/42.1 ≈142.5.\n\nBut maybe the code works correctly.\n\nAnother check: if d is zero, then sqrt(D²) is D, so D - D =0, which would make denominator zero. But d=0 is probably not a valid input for Brinell hardness test, as the indentation diameter can't be zero. So the function assumes valid inputs where D > d.\n\nSo the code should handle cases where D > d, otherwise sqrt of negative would occur.

Multiply by D (10) and π: 10 * 0.835 * 3.1416 ≈ 26.23. Then 2*3000 = 6000. 6000 / 26.23 ≈ 228.7.

The problem mentions it's for small graphs, so maybe I can use a standard algorithm like the Successive Shortest Path with Bellman-Ford, or maybe Capacity Scaling. But since it's small, maybe the simplest approach is best.\n\nFirst, I should recall how min cost flow works. The basic idea is to find augmenting paths that have the minimum cost per unit flow. For each unit of flow, find the shortest path (in terms of cost) from s to t in the residual graph, and send flow along that path. But for small F, this might be manageable. Wait, but F could be up to the total capacity, but since the graph is small, maybe this approach is feasible.\n\nWait, the Successive Shortest Path algorithm uses Bellman-Ford to find the shortest path in the residual network with respect to the reduced costs.

But for small graphs, maybe Bellman-Ford is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem states \"small graphs\", perhaps the graph isn't too big, so using Bellman-Ford each time might be okay.

When we send flow f along the edge, the residual capacity becomes cap - f, and the reverse edge gets capacity f.\n\nThe algorithm steps for min cost flow:\n\n1. Initialize flow to 0 on all edges.\n2.

So using the Successive Shortest Path with Bellman-Ford might be acceptable.\n\nAnother approach is the Cycle-Canceling algorithm, but that's probably more complex.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the algorithm:\n\n- We need to maintain residual capacities and costs. For each edge (u, v, cap, cost), the residual graph has forward edge with capacity = original cap - flow, cost = cost, and backward edge with capacity = flow, cost = -cost.\n\n- We'll represent the residual graph as an adjacency list where for each node, we have a list of (neighbor, residual_cap, cost, rev_index).

I need to implement a first-order unification function called unification_first_order that takes two terms, term1 and term2, and returns a substitution dictionary if they can be unified, otherwise None. The terms can be variables (starting with '?'), constants, or functors with arguments. Also, occurs check is required.\n\nFirst, I should recall what unification is. Unification is the process of finding a substitution that makes two terms identical. For first-order terms, variables can be substituted with other terms, but we have to avoid cases where a variable is substituted with a term that contains itself (occurs check).\n\nSo the function needs to handle different cases based on the types of term1 and term2.\n\nLet me outline the possible cases:\n\n1. Both terms are variables.\n   - If they are the same variable, return empty substitution.\n   - Else, create a substitution mapping one to the other, but must check occurs check here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, if both are variables, say ?x and ?y, then the substitution would be {?x: ?y} or vice versa. But need to check if substituting one into the other causes a cycle. Wait, occurs check is only when substituting a variable with a term that contains the variable. So if we have a substitution like ?x -> f(?x), that's invalid because of occurs check.\n\nBut in the case of two variables, substituting ?x with ?y is okay unless ?y contains ?x. Wait, but if ?y is a variable, then substituting ?x with ?y is safe as long as ?y doesn't have ?x in it. But since both are variables, there's no structure, so occurs check would only be an issue if the substitution leads to a cycle. Wait, no. For example, if term1 is ?x and term2 is ?x, then they are already the same, so empty substitution. If term1 is ?x and term2 is ?y, then the substitution is {?x: ?y}, but we need to check if ?y occurs in ?x. But since ?x is a variable, ?y can't contain ?x unless ?y is ?x, but they are different variables. Wait, maybe in this case, occurs check isn't needed because substituting a variable with another variable doesn't create a cycle. Wait, occurs check is required when a variable is being substituted with a term that contains the variable. So if term2 is a complex term that contains term1's variable, then occurs check fails.\n\nWait, the occurs check is part of the substitution process. So when trying to substitute a variable X with a term T, we need to check if X occurs in T. If it does, then it's impossible (unless T is X itself, but then it's trivial).\n\nSo for the case where term1 is a variable and term2 is some term, the substitution would be {term1: term2}, but only if term1 does not occur in term2 (occurs check).\n\nSimilarly, if term2 is a variable and term1 is a term, then {term2: term1}, but check occurs.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\n- If both are variables:\n   - If they are the same, return empty substitution.\n   - Else, create a substitution mapping the first to the second, but check if the first variable occurs in the second term. Wait, no. Wait, if term1 is a variable, say X, and term2 is a variable Y, then the substitution would be X -> Y. But occurs check here would check if X is in Y. But Y is a variable, so X is in Y only if Y is X. But since they are different variables, X is not in Y, so occurs check passes. Wait, but if X and Y are the same variable, then they are already equal, so no substitution needed.\n\nWait, maybe for two variables, the substitution is safe as long as they are not the same. Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose term1 is ?x and term2 is ?y. Then substituting ?x with ?y is allowed, and there's no occurs check issue because ?y does not contain ?x (assuming ?x and ?y are distinct variables). So occurs check is only when substituting a variable with a compound term that contains the variable.\n\nWait, occurs check is specifically for when the term being substituted into a variable contains that variable. So for example, if we have X = f(X), that's invalid because X occurs in f(X).\n\nSo in the case where term1 is a variable and term2 is a compound term, we need to check if term1", "score": 0.6666666666666666, "policy_score": 0.05, "combined_score": 0.17333333333333334, "weight": 0.2, "passed": false, "length_tokens": 2457, "metadata": {"tests": ["u=unification_first_order(('f',['?x','a']),('f',['b','?y'])); assert u=={'?x':'b','?y':'a'}"], "timeout_s": 2, "memory_mb": 256}}

Unification finds a substitution that makes two terms identical. Variables can be replaced by terms, but we have to avoid cyclic substitutions (occurs check), which means a variable can't be substituted with a term that contains itself.\n\nThe steps for unification are usually:\n\n1.

For example, ('f', 'a', '?x') represents f(a, ?x).\n\nWait, the problem says \"terms built from variables (strings starting with '?'), constants, and functors f(args...)\". So how are the terms structured in Python?\n\nHmm, the problem statement is a bit vague on the exact representation. But in typical implementations, compound terms (functors) are represented as tuples where the first element is the functor symbol, followed by the arguments. For example, f(a, b) would be ('f', 'a', 'b'). Variables are strings like '?x', and constants are strings like 'a'.\n\nSo, the input terms can be:\n\n- A string (either variable starting with '?' or constant)\n- A tuple (functor with arguments)\n\nSo, the function needs to handle these cases.\n\nLet me outline the algorithm:\n\nThe unification function will take two terms and a substitution (as a dictionary), and recursively apply substitutions while checking for occurs.\n\nBut since the problem says to return a dict or None, maybe it's better to have a helper function that accumulates the substitution.\n\nWait, standard unification algorithm uses a substitution set, and applies substitutions as it goes.\n\nThe steps:\n\nBase cases:\n\n- If term1 == term2, return substitution (but maybe they are already substituted)\nWait, but we need to apply existing substitutions first.\n\nWait, the standard algorithm is:\n\n1.

Unification finds a substitution that makes two terms identical. The substitution replaces variables with terms.

So perhaps the terms are represented as nested structures. For example, a functor 'f' with arguments 'a' and 'g(b)' would be represented as ('f', 'a', ('g', 'b')).\n\nBut the problem statement isn't explicit on the data structure. Wait, in Prolog, terms are atoms, variables, or compound terms. Here, in Python, the terms are probably represented as follows:\n- Variables: strings starting with '?', e.g., '?x'\n- Constants: strings not starting with '?', e.g., 'a', 'b'\n- Functors: tuples where the first element is the functor name (a string), followed by the arguments. For example, f(a, b) would be ('f', 'a', 'b').\n\nWait, but maybe the functors are represented as lists or tuples. The problem statement says \"functors f(args...)\", so in code, perhaps the term is a tuple where the first element is the functor name and the rest are the arguments. For example, f(a, g(b)) would be ('f', 'a', ('g', 'b')).\n\nSo, the possible term types are:\n- If it's a string starting with '?', it's a variable.\n- If it's a string not starting with '?', it's a constant.\n- If it's a tuple (or list), then the first element is the functor name, and the rest are the arguments.\n\nWait, but constants could also be numbers or other types? The problem says \"constants\" but probably in this context, all constants are strings not starting with '?'. So, variables are strings with '?', others (strings, numbers, etc.) are constants? Hmm, but the problem statement says \"strings starting with '?'\" for variables, so maybe all terms are strings or tuples. Wait, perhaps all terms are either:\n- Strings: if starts with '?', variable; else, constant.\n- Tuples: functors, where the first element is the functor name (a string), followed by the arguments (terms).\n\nWait, but maybe the functor name is a string, and the arguments are terms. So, for example, the term f(a, X) would be represented as ('f', 'a', '?x').\n\nSo, in Python terms, the data structure is:\n- Variable: str starting with '?'\n- Constant: str not starting with '?'\n- Functor: tuple where the first element is a str (functor name), followed by terms (args).\n\nWait, but maybe the functor is represented as a list?
