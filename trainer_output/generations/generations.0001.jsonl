The basic idea is to start with a high temperature and gradually cool it down, allowing the algorithm to escape local minima by sometimes accepting worse solutions.\n\nThe function signature is given: simulated_annealing_optimize(f, x0, T0, cooling, iters, seed). So parameters are the function f to minimize, initial x0, initial temperature T0, cooling rate (probably multiplicative, like T = T * cooling each step), number of iterations, and a seed for randomness.\n\nFirst, I should set the random seed for reproducibility. Since it's 1D with Gaussian steps, each iteration, we'll generate a new candidate x_new by adding a Gaussian random variable to the current x. The standard deviation might be related to the current temperature. Wait, in some implementations, the step size is proportional to the temperature. So maybe the step is generated as x_current + T * random.gauss(0, 1). Or perhaps the standard deviation is T. Let me check.\n\nIn simulated annealing, the proposal distribution can vary. For 1D, using a Gaussian step with variance proportional to temperature makes sense. So each step, we sample a new x as current x plus a Gaussian noise scaled by the current temperature.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"Gaussian steps\", so maybe the step size is determined by a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation perhaps fixed or related to temperature. The problem says \"with Gaussian steps\", so probably the step is drawn from a normal distribution, possibly scaled by the current temperature.\n\nLet me think. In standard SA, the acceptance probability for a new state with energy E_new compared to current E_old is exp(-(E_new - E_old)/T). If E_new is better (lower, since we're minimizing), we always accept. If worse, we accept with probability exp(-delta_E / T).\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Initialize x_current = x0, x_best = x0, f_current = f(x_current), f_best = f_current.\n2. Set T = T0.\n3. For each iteration in iters:\n   a. Generate a new x_new = x_current + step, where step is Gaussian. The problem says \"Gaussian steps\", so step ~ N(0, sigma). But what's sigma? Maybe sigma is proportional to T. In some implementations, the step size decreases as T decreases. So perhaps step = random.gauss(0, T). Because as T cools, the steps get smaller.\n   b. Compute f_new = f(x_new).\n   c. Compute delta_E = f_new - f_current.\n   d. If delta_E < 0 (better), accept x_new.\n   e. Else, accept with probability exp(-delta_E / T).\n   f. If accepted, set x_current = x_new, f_current = f_new.\n   g. If f_new is better than f_best, update x_best and f_best.\n   h. Cool the temperature: T = T * cooling. (Assuming cooling is a factor like 0.95, so T decreases each iteration.)\n\nWait, the cooling parameter is given as 'cooling', which is a float. So probably T is multiplied by cooling each iteration. So T starts at T0, then T = T0 * cooling, then T0 * cooling^2, etc.\n\nWait, but sometimes cooling is done as T = T0 / (1 + cooling * iteration), but the problem states the parameters as T0 and cooling, so likely it's a multiplicative factor. For example, cooling rate of 0.9 means T becomes 0.9*T each step.\n\nSo in each iteration, after possibly accepting a new x, we update T = T * cooling.\n\nWait, but in some implementations, the cooling is applied after a certain number of steps, but the problem says 'iters' is the number of iterations, so each iteration we do one step and cool once.\n\nSo steps per iteration: generate a neighbor, decide to accept or not, then cool.\n\nNow, the step generation: Gaussian steps. So each step, the new x is x_current + random.gauss(0, step_size). But what's the step_size? The problem says \"Gaussian steps\", but doesn't specify the variance. In SA, the step size often scales with temperature. So perhaps step_size = T. So new x is x_current + T * random.gauss(0,1).

So the move from current x is a Gaussian random variable. So, for each step, the new x is current x + step, where step is sampled from N(0, sigma^2). But what is sigma here? The problem doesn't mention it as a parameter, so maybe sigma is fixed, perhaps 1.0? Or maybe the step size is related to the temperature. Wait, but the parameters given are T0 and cooling. Maybe the step size is kept constant, and the temperature affects the acceptance probability.\n\nWait, in standard SA, the temperature is used in the acceptance probability, not directly in the step generation. The step generation (the proposal distribution) can be separate. So perhaps here, the steps are Gaussian with a fixed standard deviation (like 1), and the temperature is used for the Metropolis criterion.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"Gaussian steps\", which probably means that the proposal is a Gaussian distribution. So for each iteration, we generate a candidate x_new = x_current + step, where step is a random variable from a normal distribution. The standard deviation of this normal distribution might be a parameter, but since it's not given in the function parameters, perhaps it's fixed (e.g., 1.0). Alternatively, maybe the step size is adjusted based on temperature, but the problem doesn't specify that. The user probably expects a standard implementation where the step is Gaussian, perhaps with a fixed variance.\n\nWait, the problem says \"SA in 1D with Gaussian steps\". So the proposal distribution is Gaussian. So, for each iteration, the step is drawn from a normal distribution.

The solution should use dynamic programming over subsets.\n\nFirst, I remember that for counting topological sorts, especially with small n (like up to 20), a common approach is to use DP where the state is a bitmask representing the set of nodes that have been included in the sort so far. This is because 20 nodes mean 2^20 possible subsets, which is manageable (around a million states).\n\nThe idea is that for each subset S, we can determine which nodes can be added next (i.e., nodes whose in-degree from nodes not in S is zero). Wait, but how do we track the dependencies?\n\nWait, another way: For a given subset S, the nodes that can be added next are those that have all their predecessors already in S. So for each node, we can precompute its dependencies (the set of nodes that must come before it). Then, when considering subset S, a node v can be added to S if all predecessors of v are in S.\n\nSo the DP state dp[mask] represents the number of topological orderings for the subset of nodes represented by mask.\n\nThe recurrence would be: for each mask, for each node v not in mask, if all predecessors of v are in mask, then dp[mask | (1 << v)] += dp[mask].\n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty set has one ordering).\n\nBut how to compute the predecessors for each node?\n\nFirst, we need to build an adjacency list. Wait, but for the purpose of checking if all predecessors are in the mask, perhaps we can precompute for each node a bitmask of its prerequisites. Let's say for node i, prereq[i] is a bitmask where the j-th bit is 1 if there is an edge from j to i (i.e., j must come before i). Wait, no: if there's an edge j → i, then j must come before i, so for node i to be added, all j such that j → i must be in the current mask.\n\nSo for each node i, the prerequisite mask is the OR of (1 << j) for each edge (j, i). Wait, but the edges are given as (u, v), meaning u → v. So for node v, all u where (u, v) is an edge must be in the mask before v can be added.\n\nSo for each node v, we can precompute a bitmask that represents all nodes that must be present before v can be added. Let's call this pre[v].\n\nSo pre[v] = OR over all u where (u, v) is in edges of (1 << u).\n\nThen, for a given mask, a node v can be added if (pre[v] & ~mask) == 0.

For each mask, iterate over all nodes not in mask.\n\n5. For each node v not in mask, check if (pre[v] & ~mask) == 0. If yes, then dp[mask | (1 << v)] += dp[mask].\n\n6. The final answer is dp[(1 << n) - 1] modulo mod.\n\nWait, but we have to make sure that the graph is a DAG. However, the problem statement probably assumes the input is a DAG, as topological sorts exist only for DAGs.

So for each edge (u, v), we note that u must come before v.\n\nWait, but the nodes are 0-based? The problem says n is the number of nodes, and edges are tuples of ints. So assuming nodes are 0 to n-1.\n\nSo pre[v] for each node v (0 ≤ v < n) is a bitmask where for each edge (u, v), we set the u-th bit.\n\nWait, no: for edge (u, v), u is the predecessor, so to add v, u must be in the mask.

I need to define a function count_topo_sorts_mod that counts the number of topological sorts for a directed graph with n nodes (n ≤ 20), given a list of edges, modulo a given number (default 1e9+7).\n\nHmm, topological sort counts. Right, for a DAG, the number of topological orderings can be found using dynamic programming over subsets. Since n is up to 20, using bitmask DP makes sense here because 2^20 is about a million, which is manageable.\n\nSo the idea is: for each subset of nodes, we can compute the number of ways to arrange that subset in topological order. The DP state will be dp[mask], which represents the number of topological orderings for the subset represented by 'mask'.\n\nHow to transition? For a given mask, we look for all nodes that can be the last node in the topological order of this subset. A node can be last if it has no incoming edges from other nodes in the subset. Wait, no—actually, in a topological sort, the last node must have all its dependencies (predecessors) already included in the subset. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in a topological sort, for each node, all its predecessors (nodes with edges pointing to it) must come before it. So, for a subset S, a node v in S can be the last element of the topological sort of S only if all predecessors of v are in S and are placed before v. But since we're considering the last element, all predecessors of v must be in S (since S is the entire subset), and none of the predecessors can be v itself. Wait, but if v is in S, then for v to be the last element, all its predecessors must be in S (which they are, because S contains v and the predecessors must be part of the graph), but actually, the predecessors could be outside S. Wait no—if S is the subset we're considering, then the predecessors that are not in S would violate the condition. Wait, no. Because if a node u has an edge to v, then in the topological sort of the entire graph, u must come before v. But if we're considering a subset S that includes v but not u, then S cannot be a valid subset for a topological sort because u is a predecessor of v but not in S. Wait, that's not possible. Wait, no. Wait, the subset S must be a closed set under predecessors? No. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps the DP state is for subsets that are \"downward closed\" in the DAG, meaning that if a node is in the subset, all its predecessors are also in the subset. But that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no. For a topological sort, the order must have all predecessors before the node. So for any subset S that is a prefix of a topological sort, S must contain all predecessors of every node in S. So when building up the topological sort, each step adds a node with all its predecessors already in the current subset.\n\nTherefore, for the DP, the mask represents a subset S where S is a valid prefix (i.e., for every node in S, all its predecessors are also in S). Wait, no. Because when you add a node v to the subset, you can only do so if all predecessors of v are already in the subset. So the DP transitions would be adding a node v to a subset S' to form S = S' ∪ {v}, where all predecessors of v are in S'.\n\nTherefore, for each mask S, dp[S] is the number of topological orderings for the subset S. To compute dp[S], we look for all nodes v in S such that all predecessors of v are in S \\ {v} (i.e., in S without v). Then, dp[S] is the sum of dp[S \\ {v}] for all such v.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the last node added to S is v, and before that, the subset was S without v, which must have included all predecessors of v.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute for each node, the set of predecessors (in-neighbors). Let's call this pred[v].\n\n2. Initialize dp[0] = 1 (empty subset has one way).\n\n3. For each mask from 1 to (1 << n) - 1:\n\n   a.

The approach should use dynamic programming over subsets. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, topological sort counts: for a DAG, the number of valid topological orderings. Since n is up to 20, using bitmask DP where each state represents a subset of nodes that have been processed makes sense. The standard approach for counting topological sorts with DP over subsets is to track which nodes have been included in the prefix of the sort, and for each subset, count the number of ways to reach that subset.\n\nThe key idea is that a subset S is a valid prefix if all edges going into S come from within S. Wait, no: in a topological sort, all edges must go from earlier to later nodes. So for a subset S, which represents the first k nodes in the sort (where k is the size of S), every node in S must have all its incoming edges from within S. Wait, no: actually, for S to be a valid prefix, all predecessors of any node in S must also be in S. Wait, no, the other way: if a node is in S, then all its predecessors (nodes with edges pointing to it) must have been placed before it in the sort. So for S to be a valid prefix (the first |S| nodes), every node in S must have all their incoming edges coming from nodes within S. Wait, no. Let's think: if a node v is in S, then all nodes that have edges to v must also be in S. Because in the topological sort, those predecessors must come before v. So if S is the set of nodes that have been placed in the sort so far, then for any node v in S, all in-neighbors of v must also be in S. So for a given subset S, it's a valid state if for every node v in S, all predecessors of v are in S.\n\nSo the DP state will be dp[mask], which represents the number of ways to arrange the nodes in the subset represented by mask as a valid prefix of a topological sort.\n\nTo compute dp[mask], we can consider that the last node added to the subset is some node v. For v to be added to mask \\ {v}, all predecessors of v must already be in mask \\ {v}. Wait, no: when adding v to the subset S = mask \\ {v}, the predecessors of v must all be in S. So for v to be a valid node to add to S to form mask, S must contain all predecessors of v.\n\nSo the recurrence is: for each mask, dp[mask] is the sum over all nodes v in mask such that (mask without v) contains all predecessors of v, of dp[mask without v].\n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty subset, one way).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the in-degree dependencies for each node. Wait, but more precisely, for each node v, we need to know which nodes must be present before v can be added. That is, the set of predecessors (nodes with edges to v). Let's precompute for each node v, a bitmask of its predecessors. For example, pred_mask[v] is a bitmask where the i-th bit is set if there is an edge from i to v.\n\nWait, but edges are given as tuples (u, v), meaning u -> v. So for node v, all u such that (u, v) is an edge are predecessors.\n\nSo for each node v, pred_mask[v] = bitmask of all u where (u, v) is an edge.\n\nThen, for a subset S (mask), to check if v can be added (so S = mask without v), we need that pred_mask[v] is a subset of S. Because all predecessors of v must be in S.\n\nSo the condition is: (pred_mask[v] & ~S) == 0. Which is equivalent to (pred_mask[v] | S) == S, or pred_mask[v] is a subset of S.\n\nSo when building dp[mask], for each node v in mask, check if pred_mask[v] is a subset of (mask without v). If yes, then dp[mask] += dp[mask without v].\n\nNow, how to compute this.\n\nFirst, precompute for each node v, the predecessor mask.\n\nThen, iterate over all masks from 0 to (1 << n) - 1.\n\nFor each mask, for each node v not in mask (wait, no: for each mask, we look at nodes that are in mask, and check if they can be the last added node).\n\nWait, the standard approach is:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 1.\n\nFor each mask from 1 to (1<<n)-1:\n\n   dp[mask] = 0\n\n   for each node v in mask:\n\n       if", "length_tokens": 2351}

The constraints say n is up to 20, so using DP over subsets makes sense here.\n\nFirst, I remember that for counting topological sorts, one common approach is dynamic programming where the state is a bitmask representing the set of nodes that have been included in the ordering so far. The idea is that for each subset S, we can compute the number of ways to arrange the nodes in S such that all dependencies are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about the DP state. Let dp[mask] be the number of topological orderings for the subset of nodes represented by mask. The mask is a bitmask where each bit represents whether a node is included (1) or not (0).\n\nThe base case is dp[0] = 1, which represents the empty set having one way (doing nothing).\n\nFor transitions, to compute dp[mask], we consider all nodes j that can be added to the subset. A node j can be added if all its predecessors (nodes with edges pointing to j) are already in mask. Wait, no: in topological sort, a node can be added only if all its dependencies (nodes it depends on, i.e., incoming edges) are already placed. So for node j, all nodes i where there's an edge i->j must be in mask before adding j.\n\nWait, the edges are given as (u, v), which probably means u -> v. So for a node v, all u such that (u, v) is in edges must have been placed before v in the topological order.\n\nTherefore, when considering adding node j to the subset mask, we need to check that all predecessors of j (i.e., all u where (u, j) is an edge) are already in mask.\n\nSo for each mask, and for each node j not in mask, if all predecessors of j are in mask, then we can add j to mask, and dp[mask | (1 << j)] += dp[mask].\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute for each node j, the set of predecessors (nodes that have edges pointing to j). Let's call this in_edges[j].\n\n2. Initialize dp[0] = 1.\n\n3. Iterate over all possible masks from 0 to (1 << n) - 1.\n\n4. For each mask, iterate over all nodes j not in mask.\n\n5. Check if all predecessors of j are in mask. If yes, then dp[mask | (1 << j)] += dp[mask].\n\n6. The answer is dp[(1 << n) - 1], modulo mod.\n\nWait, but how do we check if all predecessors are in mask?\n\nFor each node j, the predecessors are stored as a bitmask. Let's precompute a mask for each j, say required[j], which is the bitmask of all predecessors. Then, for a given mask, to check if all predecessors are included, we can do (mask & required[j]) == required[j].\n\nYes. So required[j] is a bitmask where each bit i is 1 if there is an edge (i, j).\n\nWait, but edges are given as (u, v), so for each edge (u, v), u is a predecessor of v.\n\nSo for each node v, required[v] should be the OR of (1 << u) for all u where (u, v) is an edge.\n\nWait, no. Let's see: if there's an edge u → v, then u must come before v. So when adding v to the mask, all u that have edges to v must already be in the mask.\n\nTherefore, required[v] is the set of all u such that (u, v) is an edge. So the bitmask for required[v] would have bits set for each u in predecessors of v.\n\nSo for example, if node v has predecessors u1, u2, then required[v] = (1 << u1) | (1 << u2).\n\nThen, for a given mask, to check if all predecessors are present, we check (mask & required[v]) == required[v].\n\nYes.\n\nSo first step is to compute required for each node.\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nInitialize required = [0] * n.\n\nFor each edge (u, v) in edges:\n\n    required[v] |= (1 << u)\n\nWait, but the nodes are 0-based?

It's a sequence where every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one in the correct order. Like \"()\" is valid, but \")(\" is not. The challenge is to find the longest such substring within the input string.\n\nHmm, the problem reminds me of some classic dynamic programming or stack-based problems. I remember that using a stack can help track the indices of parentheses to find valid sequences.\n\nLet me think about how the stack approach works. The idea is to push the index of '(' onto the stack. When we encounter a ')', we pop the stack. If the stack becomes empty after popping, it means there's no matching '(', so we push the current index as a new starting point. Otherwise, the current valid length is the current index minus the index at the top of the stack.\n\nWait, let me work through an example. Let's take the sample input ')()())'.\n\nIndices: 0: ')', 1: '(', 2: ')', 3: '(', 4: ')', 5: ')'\n\nStarting with the stack. We need to initialize it with -1 as a base, maybe.

Current index 2 minus top of stack (0) is 2. So current max is 2.\n\nAt index 3: '('. Push 3. Stack: [0,3]\n\nAt index 4: ')'. Pop to 3. Now stack top is 0. 4-0=4. So current max is 4.\n\nAt index 5: ')'. Stack is [0]. Pop to empty. Push 5. Now stack is [5]. Current valid length would be 5 - 5 =0, which doesn't update max.\n\nSo the max length is 4. Which would be the substring from index 1 to 4: \"()()\", but wait the input is ')()())', so the valid parts are indices 1-2 (\"()\") and 3-4 (\"()\"), making a combined length of 4. So the answer should be 4.\n\nWait, but let me check. The input is ')()())'. Breaking it down:\n\nIndices:\n\n0: )\n\n1: (\n\n2: )\n\n3: (\n\n4: )\n\n5: )\n\nSo the valid substrings are from 1-2 (length 2), 3-4 (length 2), and perhaps 1-4 (length 4). Because 1-4 is \"()()\", which is valid. So yes, the longest is 4.\n\nSo the algorithm should return 4 for the sample.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nThe steps I thought of:\n\n- Initialize a stack with -1.\n\n- max_length = 0\n\n- Iterate through each character in the string with index i.\n\n   - If the character is '(', push i onto stack.\n\n   - Else (it's ')'):\n\n      - Pop from stack.\n\n      - If stack is empty after pop, push i (as a new starting point).\n\n      - Else, current length is i - stack[-1], update max_length if this is larger.\n\nWait, let me check the logic again.\n\nWait, when we pop, if the stack is not empty, then the current valid length is i minus the new top of the stack.\n\nWait, let's go through the example again with this logic.\n\nSample: s = ')()())'\n\ns[0] = ')'\n\nstack starts as [-1].\n\nPop stack: now empty. So push 0. Stack is [0]. max_length remains 0.\n\ns[1] = '(': push 1. Stack [0,1]\n\ns[2] = ')': pop to 1. Now stack is [0]. Current i=2. Length is 2 - 0 = 2. max_length=2.\n\ns[3] = '(': push 3.

A common way to handle parentheses validation is using a stack. Maybe I can use a stack-based approach here.\n\nWait, the standard approach for this problem is using a stack. Let me recall. The idea is to push -1 onto the stack as a base marker. Then, for each character in the string:\n\n- If it's '(', push the index.\n- If it's ')', pop the stack. If the stack becomes empty, push the current index as a new base. Otherwise, calculate the current length as current index minus the stack's top element.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's see.

The key idea is that each state in the SAM represents a set of substrings that are all suffixes of each other, and the transitions allow building the automaton incrementally.\n\nWait, the number of distinct substrings can be calculated by summing up the number of new substrings added when each character is processed. Or maybe there's a formula based on the states.\n\nOh right! In the SAM, each state has a 'len' which is the length of the longest string in that state. And the number of distinct substrings contributed by a state is len(state) - len(link(state)), where link is the suffix link. Because the suffix link points to the state with the next longest suffix, so the difference gives the number of new substrings that state adds.\n\nSo the total distinct substrings would be the sum over all states (except the initial one maybe?) of (len(state) - len(link(state))). Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the initial state is state 0. When building the SAM, each new state added contributes (current state's len - its link's len).

We create state 2 (cur), len = len(1) +1 = 2.\n- Then we traverse the suffix links of 1. The suffix link of 1 is 0. Now, check if 0 has a transition on 'b'. Initially, no. So we set 0's transition on 'b' to 2. Then set link[2] to 0? Wait no. Wait, when creating state 2, the suffix link is determined as follows: when we clone a state or not.\n\nWait maybe I'm getting confused.

One of its properties is that the number of distinct substrings can be calculated by summing up (len(link) - len(state)) for all states except the initial one. Wait, no, maybe it's the difference between the maximum length of the state and the maximum length of its suffix link.\n\nWait, each state in the SAM represents a set of substrings that are all suffixes of each other.

So the number of new substrings added by the state is maxlen(state) - maxlen(link(state)).\n\nYes, because for each state, the strings it represents have lengths from (link.len + 1) up to state.len. So the count per state is state.len - link.len.

When we add the first character, we create a new state with len 1, and its link would point to state 0. So for that state, the contribution is 1 - 0 = 1, which is correct (the single character).\n\nSo the total number of distinct substrings is the sum over all states (except the initial one) of (state.len - state.link.len).\n\nWait, but the initial state's link might be null, but in code, maybe the link for the initial state is set to -1 or something, but when building the SAM, the initial state's link is usually a null state. Hmm.\n\nWait, in the standard SAM construction, the initial state (state 0) has len 0, and its link is -1 (or some invalid value).

Wait, the suffix link of state 2 would be state 0's link? No.\n\nWait, the standard SAM construction steps:\n\nWhen adding a new character c:\n\n1. Create a new state cur with len = last.len + 1.\n2.

The problem specifies using a suffix automaton (SAM). Let me recall how SAM works.\n\nFrom what I remember, a suffix automaton is a finite automaton that recognizes all suffixes of a string, but it's structured in a way that also captures all substrings. The key property here is that the number of distinct substrings can be calculated using the SAM's structure.\n\nEach state in the SAM represents a set of substrings that have the same end positions. The transitions between states correspond to adding characters. The main idea for counting distinct substrings is that each state contributes (maxlen[state] - minlen[state] + 1) substrings. Wait, no, maybe it's the difference between the maximum length and the minimum length of the strings in that state. Wait, minlen of a state is len(link) + 1, where link is the suffix link. So the number of distinct substrings contributed by a state is maxlen - minlen + 1? Or maybe maxlen - (minlen - 1) which is maxlen - minlen + 1. Let me think.\n\nWait, for a state, the lengths of the strings it represents range from minlen to maxlen. So the number of distinct substrings in that state is maxlen - minlen + 1. But how do we get minlen? Oh right, minlen(v) = len(link(v)) + 1. So for each state, the count is (maxlen(v) - (len(link(v)) + 1) + 1) = maxlen(v) - len(link(v)).\n\nWait, let's see: if the suffix link of state v is state u, then minlen(v) = len(u) + 1. So the number of distinct substrings in state v is maxlen(v) - minlen(v) + 1 = (maxlen(v) - (len(u) + 1) ) + 1 = maxlen(v) - len(u). So yes, it's maxlen(v) - len(link(v)).\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct substrings is the sum over all states (except the initial one, maybe?) of (maxlen(v) - len(link(v))).\n\nWait, but the initial state (state 0) might have len 0. Let's check. The initial state represents the empty string. So for the initial state, maxlen is 0, and the suffix link is maybe -1 or something. But when building the SAM, the first state created (state 0) has len 0 and link -1 (or null). So when we sum over all states except the initial one, perhaps?\n\nWait, let's think of an example. Let's take s = \"a\".\n\nThe SAM for \"a\" should have states:\n\nState 0: initial, len 0, link -1.\n\nState 1: len 1, link 0.\n\nSo the distinct substrings are \"a\" and the empty string? Wait no, substrings of \"a\" are \"a\" and the empty string? Wait no, substrings are contiguous sequences. For \"a\", the substrings are \"a\" (length 1) and the empty string? Or is the empty string not counted? Wait, the problem says \"distinct substrings\". Typically, when people talk about substrings in such contexts, they might not include the empty string. Wait, but the problem statement here is for the function to return the number of distinct non-empty substrings? Or including empty?\n\nWait, let's check the standard problem. The standard problem of counting distinct substrings usually counts non-empty. For example, for \"a\", the answer is 1. For \"ab\", it's 3 (a, b, ab).\n\nBut according to the SAM approach, the sum over all states (excluding the initial state) of (maxlen - link.len) gives the number of distinct non-empty substrings.\n\nIn the \"a\" example, state 1 has maxlen 1, link is state 0 with len 0. So 1 - 0 = 1, which matches. So the sum would be 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: \"aa\". The distinct substrings are \"a\", \"aa\" → 2.\n\nBuilding the SAM:\n\nState 0: len 0, link -1.\n\nState 1: len 1, link 0. Transitions: 'a' to state 2.\n\nState 2: len 2, link 1.\n\nSo sum is (1-0) + (2-1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: \"ab\".\n\nState 0: len 0.\n\nState 1: len 1 (a), link 0.\n\nState 2: len 1 (b), link 0.\n\nState 3: len 2 (ab), link 1 (since after adding 'b' to state 1, the suffix link of state 3 would point to state 2? Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, building SAM for \"ab\":\n\nStart with state 0.\n\nAdd 'a':\n\ncurrent state is 0, create new state 1 with len 1. Check suffix links.

The problem is to define a function closest_divisors(n) that returns two integers whose product is either n+1 or n+2, and they should be as close to each other as possible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"closest\" means here. I think it refers to the pair of divisors (a, b) where a * b equals either n+1 or n+2, and the difference between a and b is minimized. Because when two numbers multiply to a given product, the pair that's closest to each other would be around the square root of the product.\n\nSo the approach would be: for both n+1 and n+2, find the pair of divisors that are closest to each other. Then compare the two pairs (from n+1 and n+2) and choose the one with the smallest difference.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So for each of the two numbers (n+1 and n+2), find their closest divisor pairs, then pick the pair from either that has the smallest possible difference.\n\nSo first, for a given number x (which is either n+1 or n+2), how do we find the closest divisors?\n\nThe standard way is to start from the integer square root of x and go downwards until we find a divisor. Because the closest pair would be around sqrt(x). For example, for x=10, sqrt is ~3.16, so check 3: 10/3 is not integer. Then 2: 10/2=5. So pair (2,5). But wait, but maybe for x=9, sqrt is 3, so 3 and 3.\n\nSo the steps for x:\n\n1. Compute the integer square root of x, let's say s = int(sqrt(x)).\n\n2. Starting from s down to 1, check if x is divisible by i. The first i found where x % i == 0 will give the pair (i, x//i), which are the closest possible divisors for x.\n\nBecause as we go down from sqrt(x), the first divisor we find will pair with the largest possible complement, making their difference minimal.\n\nSo for each x in [n+1, n+2], we find the closest pair. Then compare the two pairs (from x1 and x2) to see which has the smaller difference.\n\nWait, but how to compare? For example, if x1's closest pair has a difference of d1, and x2's has d2, then choose the pair with the smaller d.\n\nIf d1 == d2, then perhaps either is acceptable, but the problem says \"closest\", so probably either is fine, but maybe the problem expects the one from the smaller x? Or perhaps the problem allows either, but according to the problem statement, it's to find the pair for either n+1 or n+2. So whichever pair is closer (smaller difference) is the answer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For x in [n+1, n+2], find the closest divisor pair (a, b) where a <= b and a*b = x.\n\n- Compare the two pairs (from x1 and x2) based on |a - b|.\n\n- Return the pair with the smallest difference.\n\nNow, how to implement finding the closest pair for x.\n\nLet's take x, compute s = int(sqrt(x)).\n\nLoop from s down to 1:\n\n   if x % i == 0:\n\n       return (i, x // i)\n\nBecause this will give the pair where i is the largest possible <= sqrt(x), so x//i is the smallest possible >= sqrt(x), hence the closest pair.\n\nYes. For example, x=15.\n\nsqrt(15) is ~3.87, so s=3.\n\nCheck 3: 15%3=0, so pair (3,5). Difference 2.\n\nIf x=16, s=4, 16%4=0, so (4,4), difference 0.\n\nAnother example, x=10: s=3. 10%3=1, so check 2: 10%2=0, so (2,5), difference 3.\n\nSo this method works.\n\nSo for each x (n+1 and n+2), find their closest pairs.\n\nThen, compare the two pairs. Which one has the smaller difference between the two numbers.\n\nSo for each x in [n+1, n+2], compute the closest pair, then select the pair with minimal (b - a).\n\nWait, since a <= b, the difference is b - a. So the smaller the difference, the closer they are.\n\nSo for each x, compute (a, b) as closest pair, compute diff = b - a.\n\nThen choose the pair (from x1 or x2) with the smallest diff.\n\nIf both have same diff, then perhaps either is acceptable, but the problem says \"closest\", so perhaps the first one, but the problem statement may not care as long as it's one of them.

The closest pair would be the one where the two numbers are as close as possible to each other, which usually happens around the square root of the number.\n\nSo the approach would be: for each candidate number (n+1 and n+2), find the largest divisor less than or equal to the square root. Because the closest divisors are around the square root. For example, for 10, sqrt(10) is ~3.16, so the divisors are 2 and 5, but 1 and 10. The closest pair would be 2 and 5, but wait, 3.16 is between 3 and 4. Wait, 10's factors are 1x10, 2x5. The closest pair is 2 and 5 with a difference of 3. Wait, but maybe for 12, sqrt(12) is ~3.464, so the closest pair is 3 and 4 (since 3*4=12), difference 1.\n\nSo for each number m (either n+1 or n+2), iterate from int(sqrt(m)) down to 1, and check if m is divisible by i. The first i found would give the pair (i, m//i), which would have the smallest possible difference because we're starting from the square root and moving down.\n\nOnce I have the closest pairs for both m1 = n+1 and m2 = n+2, compare their differences and choose the pair with the smaller difference. If the differences are equal, maybe either is acceptable, but the problem says \"closest\", so perhaps either could be chosen, but the problem statement might specify to prefer one over the other. Wait, the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So among all possible pairs for both numbers, pick the pair with the smallest absolute difference.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1.

Because the closest pair will be around the square root.\n\nFor example, m=15: sqrt is ~3.87. Check 3: 15/3=5. So pair (3,5), difference 2. If m=16, sqrt is 4, so (4,4), difference 0.\n\nSo the algorithm for a single m is:\n\n- Let i = int(sqrt(m))\n- While i >=1:\n   - if m % i ==0, then return (i, m//i)\n   - i -=1\n\nBut since m is at least 1 (since n is a positive integer?), but n could be 0? Wait, the problem says n is an integer. But n+1 or n+2 must be positive. So n >=0, probably. Because if n is negative, n+1 or n+2 could be negative, but divisors would be negative as well. But the problem says \"two integers\", but perhaps the problem assumes positive divisors? Because otherwise, for negative numbers, there are infinite possibilities (like for m=-5, possible pairs (-1,5), (1,-5), etc.), but the closest would be same as absolute value.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2\". So if n+1 is negative, then the divisors could be negative. But the closest pair in terms of absolute difference. However, the problem probably expects positive integers, as divisors in such contexts are usually positive. Let's assume m is positive, so n+1 and n+2 are positive.

Then b = m / a. That pair (a, b) would be the closest possible.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because if you take a divisor larger than sqrt(m), then the corresponding b would be smaller, but the difference would be larger. So the closest pair is when a is the largest possible divisor less than or equal to sqrt(m).\n\nSo for each m in [n+1, n+2], compute the integer square root, then check downwards from that value until we find a divisor.\n\nLet's take an example.

So pair (2,5), difference 3.\n\nSo the closest for m=9 is (3,3), which is better. So the function returns (3,3).\n\nAnother example: n=1. Then n+1=2, n+2=3.\n\nFor m=2: sqrt(2) ~1.414.

Let's call it root. So root = int(math.isqrt(m)).\n\n- Then check from root down to 1. The first a where m % a == 0 is the largest possible a <= sqrt(m), so the corresponding b = m // a will be the smallest possible b >= sqrt(m), making the pair (a, b) the closest.\n\nSo for each m, the closest pair is (a, m//a) where a is the largest divisor <= sqrt(m).\n\nSo the steps for each m:\n\n1.

Compare the smallest differences from both m values and choose the pair with the overall smallest difference.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\" So we need to check both n+1 and n+2, find the closest pair for each, then pick the pair that's closer between the two.\n\nHow to find the closest pair for a given m?\n\nStart from the integer square root of m and go downwards. The first divisor we find will pair with m divided by that, and their difference will be minimal.\n\nFor example, take m=10. sqrt(10) is ~3.16. Check 3: 10/3 is not integer. Next 2: 10/2=5. So pair (2,5), difference 3. But wait, 10 is 1*10 (diff 9) and 2*5 (diff 3). So the closest is 2 and 5.\n\nWait, but maybe for m=9, sqrt is 3, so 3*3=9, which is perfect.\n\nSo the method for a given m:\n\n- Compute sqrt_m = int(sqrt(m))\n- Iterate from sqrt_m down to 1, check if m is divisible by i. The first i found will give the pair (i, m//i), which has the smallest possible difference.\n\nYes, because as we go down from sqrt(m), the first divisor we hit will pair with a number that's as close as possible.\n\nSo for each m (n+1 and n+2), find the pair (a, b) where a is the largest possible <= sqrt(m), so that a*b = m.\n\nThen compare the two pairs (from m1 and m2) and return the one with smaller difference.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"closest_divisors(n:int)->tuple[int,int] two integers whose product is n+1 or n+2 and are closest.\"\n\nSo the function should return the pair with the minimal difference between the two possible m's.\n\nWait, but what if both m1 and m2 have the same minimal difference? Then which one to choose? The problem says \"closest\", so if two pairs have same difference, maybe we need to pick one. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so perhaps either is acceptable. But perhaps the problem expects the pair from the smaller m? Or maybe it doesn't matter as long as the difference is minimal.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"closest\" so the pair with the smallest possible difference. So if m1 has a pair with difference d1 and m2 has d2, then choose the pair with min(d1, d2). If d1 == d2, then maybe either is acceptable. But according to the problem statement, perhaps we can choose either. But the problem might have a unique answer.\n\nLet me test with some examples.\n\nExample: n=8.\n\nn+1=9, n+2=10.\n\nFor 9: sqrt is 3, 3*3=9. So pair (3,3), difference 0.\n\nFor 10: closest pair is (2,5), difference 3.\n\nSo the answer is (3,3).\n\nAnother example: n=1.\n\nn+1=2, n+2=3.\n\nFor 2: (1,2) diff 1.\n\nFor 3: (1,3) diff 2.\n\nSo answer (1,2).\n\nAnother example: n=5.\n\nn+1=6, n+2=7.\n\n6's closest pair: sqrt(6)=2.45. Check 2: 6/2=3. So (2,3), diff 1.\n\n7 is prime: (1,7) diff 6. So answer (2,3).\n\nAnother example: n=14.\n\nn+1=15, n+2=16.\n\n15: sqrt ~3.87. Check 3: 15/3=5. So (3,5) diff 2.\n\n16: sqrt 4, 4*4=16. So (4,4) diff 0. So answer (4,4).\n\nWait, but n=14: closest divisors would be (4,4) since 16 is n+2.\n\nSo the algorithm should check both m1 and m2, find the closest pair for each, then choose the pair with the smallest difference.\n\nSo the steps for the function:\n\nFor a given n:\n\n1. Compute m1 = n+1, m2 = n+2.\n\n2. For each m in [m1, m2], find the closest factor pair.\n\n3. Compare the two pairs and return the one with the smaller difference.\n\nHow to implement finding the closest pair for a given m:\n\ndef get_closest_pair(m):\n\n    # find the largest factor <= sqrt(m", "length_tokens": 1757}

Let me recall how an LRU cache works.\n\nLRU stands for Least Recently Used. So, when the cache is full and a new item needs to be added, the least recently used item is evicted. The get and put operations should both be O(1) time complexity.\n\nThe standard way to implement this is using a combination of a hash map (dictionary in Python) and a doubly linked list. The hash map allows O(1) access to the nodes, and the doubly linked list allows O(1) removal and addition of nodes. The most recently used items are moved to the front (or head) of the list, and the least recently used is at the end (tail).\n\nWait, but in Python, there's also the OrderedDict from the collections module which can be used to implement LRU cache easily. However, the problem says \"classic LRU\", which might require implementing it from scratch without using OrderedDict. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"define LRUCache2(capacity:int) with get/put like classic LRU\". So probably, they want the implementation using a dictionary and a doubly linked list.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Create a Node class for the doubly linked list. Each node will have key, value, prev, and next pointers.\n\n2. The LRUCache2 class will have:\n   - A dictionary (hash map) to store key: node pairs.\n   - A doubly linked list to maintain the order of usage. The head will be the most recently used, tail the least.\n   - Methods to add a node to the head, remove a node, and move a node to the head.\n\nWait, but in some implementations, the head is the least recently used, and tail is the most. Wait no, usually the most recently used is added to the head, so when you access an item, you move it to the head. So the tail would be the least recently used.\n\nWait, let me think: when you get a key, you need to move it to the most recent position. So if the list is ordered from most recent (head) to least (tail), then adding new nodes to the head, and the tail is the LRU.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to have the head as the most recently used, and the tail as the least. So when we need to evict, we remove the tail.\n\nSo the structure:\n\n- head points to the most recently used node.\n- tail points to the least recently used node.\n\nWhen a get operation happens, the node is moved to the head.\n\nWhen a put operation happens, if the key exists, update the value and move to head. If it doesn't exist, add a new node to the head. If the cache is at capacity, remove the tail node (LRU) before adding the new one.\n\nWait, but how to handle the pointers. Let me outline the steps.\n\nFirst, define the Node class.\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, key, value):\n        self.key = key\n        self.value = value\n        self.prev = None\n        self.next = None\n\nThen, in LRUCache2:\n\n- capacity: int\n- cache: dict (key -> Node)\n- head: Node (most recent)\n- tail: Node (least recent)\n\nWait, but usually, a dummy head and tail are used to simplify the code. Like, have a sentinel head and tail so that you don't have to handle edge cases when the list is empty.\n\nWait, maybe using a doubly linked list with dummy head and tail nodes. So, the actual nodes are between head and tail.\n\nFor example:\n\nhead <-> node1 <-> node2 <-> ... <-> tail\n\nWhere head.next is the most recently used, and tail.prev is the least recently used.\n\nThis makes adding and removing nodes easier.\n\nSo when initializing the LRUCache2:\n\ndef __init__(self, capacity: int):\n    self.capacity = capacity\n    self.cache = {}\n    self.head = Node(None, None)\n    self.tail = Node(None, None)\n    self.head.next = self.tail\n    self.tail.prev = self.head\n\nThen, helper functions:\n\n- _add_node(node): adds the node right after head (so it becomes the most recent)\n- _remove_node(node): removes the node from the list\n- _move_to_head(node): removes the node and adds it to the head\n\nWait, but for get, when we access a node, we need to move it to the head.\n\nFor put, if the key exists, update the value and move to head.

For example, if s is \"ababab\", then p is 2 because \"ab\" repeats three times.\n\nSo the problem is to find the smallest p where len(s) is a multiple of p, and for every i from 0 to len(s)-1, s[i] equals s[i mod p].\n\nWait, how do I approach this? Let's consider possible values of p. The possible p's must be divisors of the length of s. Because if the string is a repetition of a substring of length p, then the total length n must be a multiple of p. So n = k*p for some integer k ≥ 1.\n\nSo first, I should check all possible divisors of n (the length of s) in increasing order. The first p that satisfies the condition (s is a repetition of its first p characters) will be the minimal period.\n\nBut how to check if a given p is a valid period?\n\nFor a given p, we need to check that for all i from p to n-1, s[i] == s[i - p].

So n must be divisible by p. So p must be a divisor of n.\n\nWait, for example, if s is \"aaaa\", then n=4. Possible p's are 1, 2, 4. The minimal is 1.\n\nAnother example: s = \"abab\", n=4. Divisors are 1,2,4. Check p=1: does \"a\" repeat 4 times? s is \"abab\", which is not \"aaaa\", so p=1 is invalid. Next p=2: check if s[2] == s[0] (a == a), s[3] == s[1] (b == b). Yes, so p=2 is valid.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate through possible p's in order from 1 to n (but only those that divide n), and check if they are valid periods.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. For example, for p to be a valid period, it's necessary that p divides n, but is that sufficient? No, the division is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n- For p in 1 to n (but only check p where n % p == 0):\n\n   - Check if s[0:p] repeated (n/p) times equals s.\n\nBut checking this by generating the repeated string would be O(n) per p, which could be inefficient for large n.\n\nAlternatively, check for each i from 0 to n-1, if s[i] == s[i % p].\n\nWait, for i from 0 to n-1, i % p gives the position in the base substring. So for the string to be a repetition, each character must equal the corresponding character in the base substring.\n\nSo for a given p (divisor of n), check that for all i in 0..n-1, s[i] == s[i mod p].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each candidate p (divisors of n in increasing order), check if for all k from 1 to (n/p -1), the substring s[k*p : (k+1)*p] equals s[0:p].\n\nBut again, this would be O(n) per p.\n\nBut since the minimal p is likely small, perhaps this approach is feasible.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Compute n = len(s).\n\n2. Iterate p from 1 to n:\n\n   a. If n % p != 0, skip.\n\n   b. Check if for all i from p to n-1, s[i] == s[i - p].\n\n      Because if the string is built by repeating the first p chars, then each subsequent block of p chars must match the first.\n\n      For example, when p=2 and n=6, the string is s[0:2], s[2:4], s[4:6]. So s[2] should equal s[0], s[3] equals s[1], etc.\n\n      So for i >= p, s[i] must equal s[i - p].\n\n   c. If this condition holds, return p.\n\nWait, but how does this check work?\n\nTake s = \"ababab\", p=2, n=6.\n\nCheck i from 2 to 5:\n\ni", "length_tokens": 2142}

I need to find the minimal period p of a string s. The period is the smallest p such that the string s can be formed by repeating the prefix of length p. For example, if s is \"ababab\", then p would be 2 because \"ab\" repeats three times.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the minimal period means. The period p must satisfy that len(s) is a multiple of p. So, possible values of p are the divisors of the length of s. Wait, not exactly. Because maybe the length isn't a multiple, but the problem says s is a repeat of the prefix. So, for example, if s is \"abcabc\", len is 6, p=3. But if s is \"abcab\", len is 5, which can't be divided by 3. Wait, but the problem states that s is a repeat of the prefix. So the length of s must be a multiple of p. Otherwise, it's impossible. Wait, but the problem says \"s is repeats of prefix length p\". So the length of s must be exactly k*p for some integer k ≥ 1.\n\nSo first, the possible p's are the divisors of len(s). Wait, no. Because for example, if s is \"aaaa\", the possible p could be 1 (since \"a\" repeats 4 times), but 4's divisors are 1, 2, 4. But p=2 would also work, but the minimal is 1.\n\nWait, the minimal p is the smallest possible. So the approach is to check all possible p's from 1 up to len(s), and see if s can be formed by repeating the prefix of length p.\n\nBut how to check that? For a given p, check if for all i in 0..len(s)-1, s[i] == s[i % p].\n\nWait, let's see. For example, s = \"ababab\", p=2. Then for i=0, 0%2=0 → 'a'; i=1, 1%2=1 → 'b'; i=2, 2%2=0 → 'a', etc. So yes, s[i] = s[i%p].\n\nSo the condition is that for all i in 0 to n-1, s[i] == s[i % p].\n\nBut p must divide n, because otherwise, n % p is not zero, but the length of the string must be a multiple of p. Wait, no. Wait, if p is a period, then the length of the string must be a multiple of p. Because otherwise, the last repetition would be incomplete. Wait, but the problem states that s is exactly the repetition of the prefix of length p. So the length must be exactly k*p for some integer k ≥ 1. Therefore, p must be a divisor of len(s).\n\nWait, for example, if s is \"abcabc\", len is 6. Possible p's are 1, 2, 3, 6. But p=1 would require all characters to be 'a', which they aren't. p=2: check if \"ab\" repeated 3 times is s. \"ababab\" which is not the same as \"abcabc\", so no. p=3: \"abc\" repeated twice is \"abcabc\", which matches. So p=3 is the minimal.\n\nWait, but in this case, len(s) is 6, and p=3 divides 6.\n\nAnother example: s = \"abab\", len=4. Possible p: 1, 2,4. p=1: all 'a's? No. p=2: \"ab\" repeated twice is \"abab\", which matches. So p=2 is minimal.\n\nSo the possible candidates for p are the divisors of n (n = len(s)), but we need to check the smallest possible p where the string is composed of repeating the prefix of length p.\n\nWait, but maybe p doesn't have to be a divisor? Wait no, because if s is exactly k times the prefix, then n = k*p, so p must divide n.\n\nTherefore, the minimal p must be a divisor of n.\n\nWait, but what about a case like s = \"aabaab\", n=6. Let's see. The possible p's are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nCheck p=1: all 'a's? No, because third character is 'b'. So no.\n\np=2: prefix is \"aa\". Repeating it 3 times would be \"aaaaaa\", but s is \"aabaab\", which is different. So no.\n\np=3: prefix \"aab\". Repeating twice gives \"aabaab\", which matches. So p=3 is the minimal.\n\nYes, so p must divide n.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n1. For p in 1 to n (but check possible divisors first?), find the smallest p such that:\n\n   a. n % p == 0\n\n   b. s[0:p] * (n // p) == s\n\nBut checking all p from 1 to n might be inefficient for large n, but since the problem is to write a function, perhaps for the purposes of this question, the straightforward approach is acceptable.\n\nWait, but the minimal p might not necessarily be a divisor? Wait no, because if the string is a repetition of the prefix of length p, then the length must be a multiple of p. So p must divide n.\n\nWait, let's test with an example where maybe p is not a divisor. Suppose s = \"abcab\", n=5. Can there be a p=3? Then 5/3 is not integer.

The minimal period here is the smallest p where s can be written as the repetition of its first p characters. For example, if s is \"abab\", then p would be 2 because \"ab\" repeated twice gives \"abab\".\n\nWait, but how do I check this for a given p? Let's think. For a string s of length n, the period p must satisfy that n is a multiple of p. So p has to be a divisor of n. Wait, no. Wait, if the string is a repetition of the prefix of length p, then the total length n must be equal to k*p for some integer k >=1. So p must divide n.

So the p must divide the length of s.\n\nTherefore, possible candidates for p are the divisors of len(s). But the minimal period is the smallest p such that s is equal to (s[0:p]) repeated (n/p) times.\n\nSo the approach would be: for each possible p starting from 1 up to n (the length of s), check if p divides n, and if s is equal to the prefix of length p repeated n/p times. The first such p (smallest) is the answer.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a case where a p that doesn't divide n could still work? Let's see.

Let's see.\n\nHmm, the straightforward approach would be to check all possible combinations of four elements, one from each list. But wait, if each list has n elements, that's O(n^4) time, which is way too slow for large n. Like, if n is 1000, that's 1e12 operations, which is impossible. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. Maybe I can split the problem into two parts. Like, first compute all possible sums from A and B, then compute all possible sums from C and D, and then see how many pairs of sums from the first two and last two add up to zero.\n\nWait, yes! Because (A[i] + B[j]) + (C[k] + D[l]) = 0 is equivalent to (A[i] + B[j]) = -(C[k] + D[l]). So if I can count how many times each sum occurs in A+B and in C+D, then for each sum s in A+B, I check how many times -s occurs in C+D, and multiply those counts.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute all possible sums from A and B. Store the frequency of each sum in a dictionary (hash map).\n2. Compute all possible sums from C and D. For each sum t in this second set, check if -t exists in the first dictionary. The count is incremented by the product of the frequencies.\n\nThis way, the time complexity is O(n^2) for each part, so overall O(n^2), which is manageable even for n=1000 (since 1e6 operations is feasible).\n\nLet me verify. For example, if A and B are each size n, the number of sums is n^2. Same for C and D. So building the first dictionary takes O(n^2), same for the second part. Then, for each of the n^2 sums in the second part, we do a constant-time lookup. So total time is O(n^2), which is much better than O(n^4).\n\nYes, this makes sense.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, for the first two lists, A and B:\n\nsum_ab = {}\nfor a in A:\n    for b in B:\n        s = a + b\n        sum_ab[s] = sum_ab.get(s, 0) + 1\n\nThen, for C and D:\n\ncount = 0\nfor c in C:\n    for d in D:\n        t = c + d\n        count += sum_ab.get(-t, 0)\n\nWait, but what if the sum_ab doesn't have -t? Then get returns 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the total count would be the sum over all possible t in C+D of sum_ab[-t].\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test this with a small example.\n\nSuppose A = [1, -1], B = [1, -1], C = [1, -1], D = [1, -1].\n\nWe need to count all tuples where the sum is zero.\n\nLet's compute sum_ab:\n\nPossible sums:\n\n1+1=2, 1+(-1)=0, (-1)+1=0, (-1)+(-1)=-2.\n\nSo sum_ab would have {2:1, 0:2, -2:1}.\n\nsum_cd would be same as sum_ab.\n\nNow, for each sum in sum_cd, say 2, we check sum_ab.get(-2,0) which is 1. So contributes 1*1 (since sum_cd has 2 once? Wait, no. Wait, in sum_cd, for C and D, the sums would be same as A and B.\n\nWait, for C and D:\n\nc in C is [1, -1], same for D.\n\nsum_cd:\n\n1+1=2 (count 1), 1+(-1)=0 (count 2), (-1)+1=0, (-1)+(-1)=-2 (count 1).\n\nSo sum_cd is {2:1, 0:2, -2:1}.\n\nNow, for each sum t in sum_cd:\n\nWhen t=2, -t is -2. sum_ab[-2] is 1. So adds 1 * 1 (since sum_cd has t=2 once) → 1*1=1.\n\nWhen t=0, -t is 0. sum_ab[0] is 2. sum_cd has t=0 twice (count 2), so 2*2=4.\n\nWhen t=-2, -t is 2. sum_ab[2] is 1. sum_cd has t=-2 once, so 1*1=1.\n\nTotal count: 1 +4 +1 =6.\n\nLet's check manually.\n\nHow many tuples (i,j,k,l) where sum is 0.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\nEach list has two elements, so 16 total tuples.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations where sum is zero.\n\nFor example:\n\nA[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] =0.\n\nPossible sums from A+B: 2, 0, 0, -2.\n\nPossible sums from C+D: 2, 0, 0, -2.\n\nWe need (sum_ab) + (sum_cd) =0 → sum_ab = -sum_cd.\n\nSo for sum_ab=2, sum_cd must be -2. There's 1 sum_ab=2 and 1 sum_cd=-2 → 1*1=1 tuple.\n\nsum_ab=0: sum_cd=0. 2*2=4.\n\nsum_ab=-2: sum_cd=2. 1*1=1.\n\nTotal 6. Which matches the code's result.

Then do the same for C and D, and then for each sum in the first group, check if the negative of that sum exists in the second group. Because if a + b = x, then we need c + d = -x to make the total sum zero.\n\nLet me formalize that. Let's create a dictionary (or a hash map) where keys are the sums of a + b for all a in A and b in B, and the values are the counts of how many times each sum occurs.\n\nSimilarly, create another dictionary for c + d for all c in C and d in D.\n\nThen, for each sum x in the first dictionary, if -x is present in the second dictionary, multiply the counts from both dictionaries and add to the total.\n\nThis way, the time complexity would be O(n^2) for each pair, so overall O(n^2), which is much better than O(n^4). That's a common technique for these kinds of sum problems, like the 4Sum II problem on LeetCode.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. For example, if A and B each have n elements, then there are n^2 sums. Same for C and D. Then, looking up in the hash map is O(1) per operation, so the total time is O(n^2) for building the maps and O(n^2) for checking the pairs, which totals O(n^2).\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Create a dictionary for the sum of A and B.\n   For each a in A:\n      For each b in B:\n          sum_ab = a + b\n          increment the count for sum_ab in the dict.\n\n2. Similarly, create a dictionary for sum of C and D.\n\n3. Initialize a counter to 0.\n   For each sum_ab in dict1:\n       if -sum_ab is in dict2:\n           counter += dict1[sum_ab] * dict2[-sum_ab]\n\n4. Return the counter.\n\nWait, but what if some sums in dict2 don't have a corresponding -sum_ab? Then we just skip them.\n\nThis approach should correctly count all possible combinations where the four elements sum to zero.\n\nLet me test with a small example.\n\nSuppose A = [1], B = [-1], C = [0], D = [0].\n\nThen sum_ab is 0 (1 + (-1)), count 1.\n\nsum_cd is 0 + 0 = 0, count 1.\n\nLooking for -sum_ab which is 0, which exists in dict2. So total is 1*1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: A = [0,1], B = [0, -1], C = [0,1], D = [0, -1].\n\nsum_ab possibilities:\n\n0+0=0, 0 + (-1) = -1, 1+0=1, 1 + (-1)=0.\n\nSo dict1: 0:2, -1:1, 1:1.\n\nsum_cd:\n\n0+0=0, 0 + (-1) = -1, 1+0=1, 1 + (-1)=0.\n\ndict2: 0:2, -1:1, 1:1.\n\nNow, for each sum in dict1:\n\nsum_ab = 0: need 0 in dict2. 2*2=4.\n\nsum_ab = -1: need 1 in dict2. 1*1=1.\n\nsum_ab = 1: need -1 in dict2. 1*1=1.\n\nTotal is 4 +1 +1 =6.\n\nLet's count manually:\n\nPossible tuples where a + b + c + d =0.\n\nPossible a+b values:\n\n0, -1, 1, 0.\n\nFor each a+b=0: need c+d=0. There are 2 possibilities for a+b=0 (from A,B), and 2 for c+d=0. So 2*2=4.\n\nFor a+b=-1: need c+d=1. Which has 1 possibility. So 1*1=1.\n\nFor a+b=1: need c+d=-1. Which has 1 possibility. So 1*1=1.\n\nTotal 6. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, for the first two lists, A and B, create a Counter.\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict or Counter.\n\nWait, using Counter from collections.\n\nWait, in Python, we can do:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nsum_ab = Counter(a + b for a in A for b in B)\n\nSimilarly for sum_cd.\n\nThen, total = 0\n\nfor x, count in sum_ab.items():\n\n    total += count * sum_cd.get(-x, 0)\n\nWait, but sum_cd is a Counter for c + d.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, sum_cd would be Counter(c + d for c in C for d in D)\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef four_sum_count_zero(A, B, C, D):\n\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    sum_ab = Counter(a + b for a in A for b in B)\n\n    sum_cd = Counter(c +", "length_tokens": 1100}

The function is called four_sum_count_zero with four lists as inputs.\n\nLet me think. The brute force approach would be checking all possible combinations of the four indices. But that's O(n^4), which is way too slow for even moderate n. Like, if each list has 100 elements, 100^4 is 100 million, which might be manageable, but for 1000 elements, it's 1e12 operations, which is impossible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nHmm. Maybe I can split the problem into two parts. For example, compute all possible sums of A and B, then all possible sums of C and D, and then find pairs of sums that add up to zero.\n\nWait, right! Because A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] = 0 is equivalent to (A[i] + B[j]) = -(C[k] + D[l]). So if I can compute all possible sums from A and B, store them in a hash map with their counts, then for each sum from C and D, check how many times the negative of that sum exists in the first map.\n\nYes, that would reduce the time complexity. Let's see: for the first two lists, A and B, each of size n, there are n^2 possible sums. Similarly for C and D. So total time is O(n^2) for each part, which is O(n^2) overall, which is feasible for n up to 1000 (since 1e6 is manageable).\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Create a dictionary (or defaultdict) to store the sum of every pair from A and B, counting how many times each sum occurs.\n\n2. Iterate through all pairs in C and D, compute their sum, then check how many times the negative of that sum is present in the dictionary. Add that count to the result.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nLet me test this logic with a small example.\n\nSuppose A = [1, 2], B = [-1, -2], C = [3, 4], D = [-3, -4].\n\nPossible sums for A+B: 1 + (-1) = 0, 1 + (-2) = -1, 2 + (-1) = 1, 2 + (-2) = 0. So the counts are {0:2, -1:1, 1:1}.\n\nC+D sums: 3 + (-3) = 0, 3 + (-4) = -1, 4 + (-3) = 1, 4 + (-4) = 0. So the sums are 0, -1, 1, 0.\n\nFor each sum in C+D:\n\n- 0: need to find -0 = 0 in A+B. Count += 2 (since A+B has 0 twice)\n- -1: need 1. A+B has 1 once. Count +=1\n- 1: need -1. A+B has -1 once. Count +=1\n- 0: same as first, adds 2.\n\nTotal count is 2 +1 +1 +2 = 6. Let's check all possible tuples.\n\nWait, the correct tuples would be where A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] =0.\n\nBut according to the example:\n\nFor C+D sum 0 (from 3-3), the A+B sum needs to be 0. There are 2 possibilities in A+B (0 occurs twice). So 2 tuples here.\n\nSimilarly, for C+D sum -1 (3-4), need A+B sum to be 1, which occurs once. So 1 tuple.\n\nFor C+D sum 1 (4-3), need A+B sum -1, which occurs once. 1 tuple.\n\nFor C+D sum 0 (4-4), again 2 tuples.\n\nTotal 2+1+1+2=6. Which matches. So the logic seems correct.\n\nAnother example: if all four lists are [0], then the sum is 0+0+0+0=0. So the count should be 1. Let's see:\n\nA+B sums: 0+0=0, count 1.\n\nC+D sums: 0+0=0. For each sum (0), we look for -0=0 in the first map. So count +=1. Total 1. Correct.\n\nOkay, so the approach works.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, create a dictionary for the sum of A and B.\n\nWe can loop through each element in A and B, compute the sum, and increment the count in the dictionary.\n\nThen, loop through C and D, compute their sum, check if -sum is in the dictionary, and add the count.\n\nSo code steps:\n\n- Initialize a defaultdict(int) or a regular dict for the first part.\n\n- For a in A:\n   for b in B:\n      sum_ab = a + b\n      dict[sum_ab] +=1\n\n- Then, result =0\n  for c in C:\n     for d in D:\n         sum_cd = c + d\n         target = -sum_cd\n         if target in dict:\n             result += dict[target]\n\n- Return result.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nNow, check for possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if all elements are zero? Then for each pair in A and B, sum is 0. So the dict will have sum 0 with count n^2. Similarly for C and D, each sum is 0, so for each of n^2 pairs, we add n^2. So total count is n^4. Which is correct, since all combinations sum to zero.\n\nAnother case: A=[1], B=[1], C=[-1], D=[-1]. Then A+B sum is 2. C+D sum is -2. So target for sum_cd is 2 (since -(-2)=2). So count +=1.

Hmm.\n\nFirst, the brute force approach would be O(n^4), which is way too slow for large n. Like, if each list has 1000 elements, that's 1e12 operations.

For example, compute all possible sums from A and B, and then all possible sums from C and D. Then for each sum in the first group, check if there's a corresponding sum in the second group that adds up to zero.\n\nWait, right. Let's say I compute all possible sums of A[i] + B[j] and store them in a dictionary where the key is the sum and the value is the count of how many times that sum occurs. Then, for each sum in C[k] + D[l], I check if the negative of that sum exists in the first dictionary. Because if (A[i] + B[j]) + (C[k] + D[l]) = 0, then (C[k] + D[l]) = - (A[i] + B[j]).\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1.

For each c in C, each d in D:\n   - Compute sum_cd = c + d\n   - Check if -sum_cd exists in the dictionary. If yes, add the count from the dictionary to the counter.\n\nThis way, the time complexity is O(n^2) for building the first dictionary, and O(n^2) for checking the second part. So total O(n^2), which is manageable for n up to 1000 (since 1e6 operations is feasible).\n\nLet me test this logic with a small example.\n\nSuppose A = [1, -1], B = [0], C = [0], D = [0].\n\nPossible sums from A and B: 1+0=1, -1+0=-1. So the dictionary would have {1:1, -1:1}.\n\nNow for C and D: 0+0=0. So sum_cd is 0. We check for -0 which is 0. Wait, but the sum_ab needs to be -sum_cd. So sum_ab should be 0. But in the dictionary, there's no 0. So the count would be 0.\n\nWait, but in this case, the correct answer is 0 because none of the sums add up to zero. Wait, no. Wait, the tuples would be (i,j,k,l) where A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] =0.\n\nIn the example, C and D are both [0], so C[k] + D[l] is 0+0=0. So sum_ab needs to be 0. But in the dictionary, sum_ab is 1 and -1, so no matches. So the count is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: A = [1, 0], B = [-1, 0], C = [0], D = [0].\n\nSum_ab: 1 + (-1) = 0, 1+0=1, 0 + (-1) = -1, 0+0=0. So the dictionary would have 0:2, 1:1, -1:1.\n\nThen sum_cd is 0+0=0. So looking for -0=0. The count is 2. So total tuples would be 2.\n\nWhich makes sense: the tuples where (A[i], B[j]) are (1,-1) and (0,0), so two combinations. So yes, the count is 2.\n\nOkay, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, create a defaultdict for the sum_ab.\n\nWait, but using a dictionary. For example:\n\nsum_ab = {}\nfor a in A:\n    for b in B:\n        s = a + b\n        sum_ab[s] = sum_ab.get(s, 0) + 1\n\nThen, for C and D:\n\ncount = 0\nfor c in C:\n    for d in D:\n        s = c + d\n        count += sum_ab.get(-s, 0)\n\nYes, that's the plan.\n\nSo the function four_sum_count_zero would return count.\n\nLet me check edge cases.\n\nWhat if all elements are zero? Like A, B, C, D each have n elements of 0.\n\nThen sum_ab for all a, b is 0, so sum_ab[0] = n^2.\n\nsum_cd is 0 for all c, d. So for each of the n^2 combinations, we add sum_ab.get(0,0) which is n^2. So total count is n^2 * n^2 = n^4. Which is correct, since all possible tuples sum to zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when all lists are empty. But the problem says lists of integers, but perhaps n is zero. But the problem probably assumes non-empty lists, but in code, if all lists are empty, the loops would not run and return 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nThe function signature is four_sum_count_zero(A, B, C, D) -> int.\n\nSo:\n\ndef four_sum_count_zero(A, B, C, D):\n    sum_ab = {}\n    for a in A:\n        for b in B:\n            s = a + b\n            sum_ab[s] = sum_ab.get(s, 0) + 1\n ", "length_tokens": 1223}
